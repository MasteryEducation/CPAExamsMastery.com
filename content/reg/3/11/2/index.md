## 11.2 Formation, Operation, and Termination of Various Entities

Business entities form the legal backbone of commercial activities, providing frameworks for ownership, governance, risk management, and taxation. Whether one chooses a simple sole proprietorship, a partnership, a limited liability company (LLC), or a corporation, the formation process, ongoing operations, and ultimate termination of these entities follow defined legal and regulatory steps. This section walks you through the typical life cycle of various business structures, with a focus on practical steps and compliance insights.

Forward-looking accountants, attorneys, and entrepreneurs should understand these foundational principles to better advise clients or manage their own enterprises. Below, you will find detailed step-by-step outlines for the formation processes (such as filing Articles of Incorporation or drafting partnership agreements), as well as overviews of operational best practices and termination procedures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview of Common Business Entities

The choice of business entity affects liability protection, tax treatment, management structure, and record-keeping requirements. The most common forms of business structures include:

• Sole Proprietorship  
• General Partnership  
• Limited Partnership (LP)  
• Limited Liability Company (LLC)  
• C Corporation  
• S Corporation  

While each structure differs in complexity, there is a general life cycle that applies: (1) Formation or registration, (2) Operation and ongoing compliance, and (3) Dissolution or termination.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Formation

Understanding how to properly form an entity is critical to ensuring it enjoys the liability and tax benefits that come with its particular legal structure. Below, we outline the processes typically involved for several major entity types.

### Sole Proprietorship

A sole proprietorship is the simplest form of business. It requires little more than deciding to operate under your own name or obtaining a “doing business as” (DBA) certificate if operating under a trade name.

• No formal filing (beyond licenses or permits required by local jurisdictions).  
• The individual is personally liable for all business debts.  
• Profits and losses flow to the owner’s personal tax return (Schedule C for federal tax in the U.S.).

### General Partnership

General partnerships involve two or more persons carrying on a business for profit. While not always required by law, drafting a written partnership agreement is highly recommended.

**Step-by-Step Outline for Forming a General Partnership**  
1. Agree upon partnership terms (roles, responsibilities, capital contributions, division of profits or losses).  
2. Draft a formal partnership agreement.  
   - Outline each partner’s authority, management responsibilities, and methods of dispute resolution.  
   - Specify how profits/losses are shared and under what conditions additional partners may be admitted.  
3. Register a trade name (DBA) if operating under a name different from the partners’ legal names.  
4. Obtain any required local or state licenses.  
5. Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS (if employing staff or if otherwise required).  

### Limited Partnership (LP)

A Limited Partnership contains both general and limited partners. General partners oversee management and bear full liability; limited partners have limited liability up to their capital contributions, but cannot participate in day-to-day management without losing limited liability status.

**Key Formation Steps**  
1. Draft and file a Certificate of Limited Partnership with the appropriate state agency (often the Secretary of State).  
2. Prepare a written partnership agreement detailing:  
   - Roles of general and limited partners  
   - Distribution of profits  
   - Capital contributions and withdrawal rights  
   - Voting rights and conditions for dissolution  
3. Pay state filing fees and, if necessary, publish a notice of formation as required by specific state statutes.  
4. Obtain an EIN if required.  

### Limited Liability Company (LLC)

An LLC is a hybrid structure that combines the limited liability of a corporation with the pass-through taxation of a partnership (by default). The specific compliance requirements vary by state.

**Step-by-Step Outline for Forming an LLC**  
1. Choose an available business name that meets state LLC naming requirements (e.g., must include “LLC” or “Limited Liability Company”).  
2. Draft Articles of Organization:  
   - Include the LLC’s name, registered agent, purpose, and duration (if not perpetual).  
   - File the Articles of Organization with the state and pay the required filing fee.  
3. Create an LLC Operating Agreement (highly recommended, even if not mandatory):  
   - Outline member roles, voting rights, distribution of profits/losses, and procedures for transfers of membership interests.  
   - Clarify management structure (member-managed vs. manager-managed).  
4. Obtain an EIN from the IRS if applicable.  
5. Fulfill publication requirements if required by state law (e.g., some states require published notices in local newspapers).  
6. Obtain business licenses or permits as necessary.  

Below is a simple flowchart illustrating the LLC formation process:

    D --> E["Obtain EIN and<br/>Necessary Licenses"]
    E --> F["Fulfill Any<br/>Publication Requirement"]
    F --> G["Begin Operations"]
```

### C Corporation

A C Corporation is a legal entity separate from its owners (shareholders). It affords limited liability but is subject to corporate-level income tax, and shareholders are taxed again on dividends (commonly called “double taxation”).

**Step-by-Step Outline for Forming a C Corporation**  
1. **Pick a Corporate Name**: It must comply with state naming rules (e.g., include “Inc.,” “Corporation,” or a similar designation).  
2. **Draft and File Articles of Incorporation**:  
   - State the corporation’s name, number of shares authorized, address, and registered agent.  
   - Submit filing to the state’s Secretary of State along with required fees.  
3. **Create Corporate Bylaws**:  
   - Outline governance rules, responsibilities of directors/officers, how meetings are conducted, etc.  
   - Bylaws are typically an internal document, not filed with the state.  
4. **Hold an Organizational Meeting**:  
   - Elect the initial board of directors if not named in the Articles.  
   - Adopt the Bylaws.  
   - Authorize issuance of shares.  
   - Appoint officers.  
5. **Obtain an EIN and Register for Taxes**:  
   - National (e.g., IRS in the U.S.) and sometimes state tax registration is required.  
6. **Issue Stock Certificates**:  
   - Document the ownership stake of initial shareholders.  
7. **Ongoing Compliance**:  
   - File annual reports and pay any state corporate franchise taxes where required.

    D --> E["Issue Shares and<br/>Appoint Officers"]
    E --> F["Obtain EIN and<br/>Register for Taxes"]
    F --> G["Maintain<br/>Ongoing Compliance"]
```

### S Corporation

An S Corporation is not formed as a separate entity from a C Corporation at the state level. Instead, S Corporation status is an election made with the IRS, subject to eligibility requirements (e.g., limited to 100 shareholders, all of whom must be individuals or certain trusts, and only one class of stock).

**Basic Formation and Election Steps**  
1. Form a corporation in the same manner as a C Corporation at the state level.  
2. File IRS Form 2553 (Election by a Small Business Corporation) within the prescribed time limits (generally 2 months and 15 days after the start of the tax year for which the election is made).  
3. Confirm ongoing eligibility (e.g., number of shareholders, domestic entity, types of shareholders).  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Operation

Once formed, a business entity must abide by ongoing obligations to maintain its good standing. This involves administrative, legal, tax, and often shareholder or member formalities.

### Administrative and Regulatory Compliance

• **Annual Filings**: Many states require filing annual or biennial reports, including updated information about registered agents, business addresses, or membership changes.  
• **Record-Keeping**:  
  - Corporations should maintain minutes of board/shareholder meetings, record major resolutions, and track stock transfers.  
  - Partnerships and LLCs should retain partnership or operating agreements, capital contribution records, and major decisions in writing.  
• **Licenses and Permits**: Renew any expiring business licenses or professional permits.  

### Tax Obligations

• **Classification**:  
  - Single-member LLCs are disregarded for federal tax purposes by default; multi-member LLCs are taxed as partnerships unless otherwise elected.  
  - Partnerships file Form 1065 (U.S. Return of Partnership Income) and issue K-1 schedules to partners.  
  - C Corporations file Form 1120; S Corporations file Form 1120-S.  
• **Employment Taxes**: If the entity has employees, payroll tax registration and withholding obligations apply.  
• **Estimated Taxes**: Partnerships and pass-through entities do not ordinarily pay taxes at the entity level (except for specific states or localities), but owners/partners/shareholders may need to pay quarterly estimated taxes.  

### Funding and Capital Changes

• **Issuing Additional Shares (Corporations)**: Must comply with corporate law, board/shareholder approvals, and securities regulations.  
• **Capital Contributions (LLCs and Partnerships)**: Members or partners may contribute cash, property, or services, affecting their ownership interests and tax basis.  
• **Loans and Financing**: Entities often secure loans secured by business assets. Keep personal and business funds separate to maintain liability protections.  

### Governance and Decision-Making

• **Corporations**: Handled by the board of directors and corporate officers. Shareholders typically vote on major issues (e.g., mergers, amendments to Articles of Incorporation).  
• **LLCs**: Member-managed or manager-managed. The Operating Agreement governs major decisions and day-to-day operations.  
• **Partnerships**: Each general partner typically has the authority to bind the partnership unless partnership agreement states otherwise.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Termination

Eventually, a business may cease operations due to retirement, merger/acquisition, or simply because the venture has run its course. Properly winding down an entity ensures owners are protected from lingering liabilities and that tax and legal obligations are satisfied.

### Dissolution and Winding Up

1. **Board Resolution / Consent**  
   - Corporations: The board of directors proposes dissolution, and shareholders approve it.  
   - LLCs/Partnerships: Follow the procedure in the operating or partnership agreement regarding member or partner consent.  
2. **File Articles (or Certificate) of Dissolution** with the appropriate state agency (Secretary of State in most jurisdictions).  
3. **Notify Creditors**: Provide formal notice of dissolution, set a claims filing deadline, and pay outstanding debts.  
4. **Liquidate Assets**: Sell or distribute remaining assets to pay liabilities.  
5. **Distribute Net Assets**: After debts are paid, distribute leftover assets to owners in line with ownership interests and state law.  
6. **Cancel Local Licenses and Permits**: Ensure business names, trade names, and any professional licenses are canceled if no longer in use.  
7. **Final Tax Filings**:  
   - File final business tax returns (e.g., Form 1120 for C Corporation, Form 1065 for a partnership).  
   - Mark the return as “final” and ensure all payroll or sales taxes are settled.  

### Post-Dissolution Liabilities

If notice was improper or incomplete, creditors can potentially file late claims. Maintaining accurate records of notification procedures, or abiding by statutory “bar dates,” helps mitigate these risks. Some states permit shortcuts like “short-form dissolution” if the entity never actually carried on business or has minimal assets/liabilities.

### Special Termination Cases

• **Administrative Dissolution**: States may administratively dissolve outdated or non-compliant entities. Reinstatement may be possible if issues are resolved within a statutorily allowed time.  
• **Merger or Conversion**: Another path to termination is merging with another entity or converting (e.g., from an LLC to a corporation). The original entity ceases to exist in a legal sense, though there may be continuity of business operations.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Practical Example

Consider a small tech startup that began as an LLC. After two years of strong growth and investor interest, the owners decide to convert to a C Corporation for better access to venture capital funding. The steps they would take include:

1. Approve a Plan of Conversion (members vote to convert to a corporation).  
2. File a Certificate of Conversion and Articles of Incorporation with their state, paying any required fees.  
3. Hold an organizational meeting, adopt bylaws, appoint directors/officers, and issue new shares.  
4. Decide if S Corporation status would be advantageous for an immediate or future election.  
5. Finally, if at a later stage the business is acquired, the owners may dissolve any leftover LLC or corporation once all property is transferred and liabilities are covered, filing the proper dissolution documents with the state and final tax returns with the IRS.  

This holistic narrative illustrates how business structures can evolve and how critical it is to properly form, operate, and eventually wind down an entity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Considerations, Best Practices, and Common Pitfalls

• **Segregation of Assets**: Co-mingling personal and business assets can lead to “piercing the corporate veil,” exposing personal liability.  
• **Compliance Deadlines**: Missing annual filings or franchise tax payments can result in penalties or involuntary dissolution.  
• **Written Agreements**: Formal partnership or LLC operating agreements reduce internal disputes and clarify uncertainties.  
• **Tax Elections**: Timely filing a Subchapter S election (Form 2553) is vital if S Corporation status is desired.  
• **Convenience vs. Liability**: Sole proprietorships and general partnerships are simple, but they offer no liability protection for owners.  
• **Proper Dissolution**: Skipping final filings or ignoring creditor notifications can create ongoing liability for owners.

## Mastering Formation, Operation, and Termination of Various Entities Quiz

{{< quizdown >}}

### Which document is used to officially create a corporation in most U.S. states?

- [ ] Corporate Bylaws
- [x] Articles of Incorporation
- [ ] Operating Agreement
- [ ] Certificate of Good Standing

> **Explanation:** The Articles of Incorporation (sometimes called the Certificate of Incorporation) are filed with the state to form a corporation. Bylaws are an internal governance document, and an operating agreement is typical for an LLC.

### Which of the following is NOT typically included in a Partnership Agreement?

- [ ] Profit and loss allocation methods
- [x] Corporate share issuance procedures
- [ ] Provisions for admitting new partners
- [ ] Dispute resolution procedures

> **Explanation:** A partnership agreement generally covers management roles, profit distribution, partner admission, and dispute resolution. It does not address share issuance, which is a corporate concept.

### In an LLC, members have limited liability in most cases unless:

- [ ] The LLC is manager-managed.
- [ ] They all agree to waive limited liability.
- [x] They co-mingle personal and business assets or commit fraud.
- [ ] The LLC elects to be taxed as a corporation.

> **Explanation:** LLC members typically enjoy limited liability, but it can be compromised if they fail to maintain separation of personal assets or engage in fraudulent behavior. 

### An advantage of the S Corporation election is:

- [x] Pass-through taxation at the shareholder level.
- [ ] The ability to have unlimited shareholders.
- [ ] Access to foreign investors without restriction.
- [ ] Exemption from all state taxes.

> **Explanation:** The main attraction of an S Corporation is that business profits are generally taxed only once at the shareholder level. There are, however, restrictions on the number of shareholders and who can be a shareholder.

### Which of the following steps typically occurs first when terminating a corporation?

- [ ] Filing final tax returns
- [ ] Liquidating assets
- [x] Obtaining shareholder approval or board resolution for dissolution
- [ ] Distributing remaining proceeds to shareholders

> **Explanation:** Before official dissolution can occur, the board of directors and/or the shareholders must approve the dissolution in a formal resolution or vote.

### What is the main difference between an LLC Operating Agreement and Corporate Bylaws?

- [x] LLC Operating Agreements govern member-managed or manager-managed structures, whereas Corporate Bylaws govern a board of directors and officers.
- [ ] LLC Operating Agreements are filed with the state; Corporate Bylaws are not.
- [ ] Corporate Bylaws govern shareholder meetings exclusively, while Operating Agreements govern tax matters.
- [ ] They have no meaningful difference in any jurisdiction.

> **Explanation:** LLC Operating Agreements and Corporate Bylaws both set internal governance rules, but Bylaws typically address formal corporate structures with directors/officers, while Operating Agreements address the flexible member-managed or manager-managed structure of an LLC.

### Which of the following may trigger administrative dissolution of an entity by a state?

- [x] Failure to file an annual report or pay required fees
- [ ] Issuing stock dividends to shareholders
- [x] Failure to maintain a registered agent
- [ ] Recapitalizing the corporation

> **Explanation:** Generally, if an entity does not keep up with annual reports, franchise fees, or a valid registered agent, the state may administratively dissolve the business. Issuing dividends or recapitalizing typically has no such effect.

### If a new partner joins a general partnership that has pre-existing liabilities, the new partner’s personal liability for those pre-existing debts is typically:

- [x] Limited to their capital contribution unless there is an agreement to assume past obligations.
- [ ] Unlimited for all partnership debts, both past and future, automatically.
- [ ] Limited to future debts only; no liability for past debts.
- [ ] Based on the election of the partnership’s tax classification.

> **Explanation:** A new partner is not automatically responsible for prior debts beyond their contributed capital, unless the partnership agreement or the new partner explicitly acknowledges such liability.

### Which of the following is a key characteristic of a limited partnership?

- [ ] All partners participate in active management and have unlimited liability for partnership debts.
- [x] At least one general partner with unlimited liability and one or more limited partners with liability limited to their contributions.
- [ ] All partners have limited liability and can manage without losing protection.
- [ ] The entity is always taxed as a corporation.

> **Explanation:** Limited partnerships must have at least one general partner (with unlimited liability) and at least one limited partner (with liability limited to investment). Limited partners lose their liability protection if they engage in day-to-day management.

### The final step typically required before fully terminating an LLC is:

- [x] Filing the final tax return and marking it “final.”
- [ ] Voting to elect new members to keep operations going.
- [ ] Hiring a new registered agent.
- [ ] Issuing new membership interests.

> **Explanation:** Once an LLC is in the dissolution process, it should pay all debts, liquidate assets, and file a final tax return with the IRS or local authority indicating the entity has ceased operations.
