## 5.4 Civil and Criminal Penalties Imposed on Taxpayers

This section explores the broad spectrum of civil and criminal penalties that can be imposed on taxpayers. Both individuals and business entities must understand their obligations and potential liabilities under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and other laws enforced by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By being aware of possible sanctions—ranging from simple negligence penalties to severe fraud and criminal charges—taxpayers and tax professionals can take proactive steps to avoid costly mistakes and ensure compliance.

This discussion builds upon concepts introduced in earlier chapters, especially those related to ethics (Chapter 3) and IRS procedures (Chapter 5). While it is crucial for CPAs to adhere to ethical and professional guidelines, clients also bear responsibilities that can expose them to various penalties when those obligations are not met.

### Overview of Civil vs. Criminal Penalties

The tax law differentiates between civil and criminal penalties primarily by the degree of wrongdoing and the burden of proof required to assess them. In civil cases, the burden of proof is typically a “preponderance of the evidence.” By contrast, in criminal cases, the government must prove the taxpayer’s guilt “beyond a reasonable doubt.”

• Civil penalties: Imposed when taxpayers fail to comply with certain tax regulations, even if they did not act with willful intent. Examples include accuracy-related penalties for negligence or substantial understatements of tax.  
• Criminal penalties: Imposed when the taxpayer’s conduct rises to a level of willfulness, fraud, or deliberate evasion of tax laws. Criminal penalties can lead to fines, imprisonment, or both.

Below is a visual overview of how key categories of penalties branch off within the U.S. tax system:

### Common Civil Penalties for Taxpayers

Civil penalties are monetary in nature and do not involve incarceration. They are the most frequently encountered types of penalties because errors, oversights, or misunderstandings in tax returns are common. Civil penalties encompass negligence, substantial understatement, accuracy-related concerns, and failure to file or pay.

#### Negligence Penalty

• Definition: The IRS defines negligence as a failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the tax code or exercise ordinary and reasonable care in preparing a return.  
• IRC Provision: IRC §6662 imposes a 20% penalty on the portion of underpayment attributable to negligence or disregard of rules and regulations.  
• Examples of Negligence:  
  – Failing to keep adequate books and records of income and expenses.  
  – Understating income because of careless recordkeeping, not because of an intentional misstatement.  
  – Improperly claiming deductions or credits without making a reasonable effort to verify eligibility.  

#### Substantial Understatement Penalty

• Definition: A “substantial understatement” typically occurs when the amount of tax understated on the return exceeds the greater of (1) 10% of the correct tax, or (2) $5,000 for individuals. Different thresholds apply for corporations.  
• IRC Provision: This penalty also falls under IRC §6662 at a 20% rate.  
• Considerations:  
  – If the taxpayer had substantial authority for a position, or if the taxpayer adequately disclosed the position and had a reasonable basis for it, the penalty may be reduced or avoided.  
  – The penalty helps discourage taxpayers from claiming overly aggressive positions without a sound foundation.  

#### Accuracy-Related Penalties

Accuracy-related penalties encompass negligence, substantial understatement, and other types of infractions such as valuation misstatements. While the penalty rates for different categories within §6662 can vary, the standard rate is generally 20% of the underpayment.

##### Relevant Example

Suppose a self-employed individual fails to report a portion of business income because they relied on a bank deposit analysis that accidentally omitted several cash receipts. The taxpayer did not intend to defraud the government, but their omission demonstrates insufficient care. In this scenario, the IRS could impose an accuracy-related penalty for negligence, subjecting the unreported portion of the tax liability to an additional 20% penalty.

#### Failure-to-File and Failure-to-Pay Penalties

Two of the most straightforward civil penalties relate to timely filing and payment:

• Failure-to-File Penalty (IRC §6651(a)(1)): This penalty is generally 5% of the unpaid tax per month (or part of a month) the return is late, up to a maximum of 25%.  
• Failure-to-Pay Penalty (IRC §6651(a)(2)): This penalty is usually 0.5% of the unpaid tax per month (or part of a month), up to a maximum of 25%.  

When both a failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalty apply, there are coordination rules to ensure the taxpayer is not excessively penalized. However, the combined impact can be significant, emphasizing the importance of timely filing and payment.

---

### Civil Fraud Penalty

“Fraud” in tax law implies intentional wrongdoing with the purpose of evading tax. Civil fraud is more severe than mere negligence:

• Definition: Willful intent to evade a tax or intentionally file a false return.  
• IRC Provision: IRC §6663 imposes a 75% penalty on the underpayment attributable to fraud.  
• Burden of Proof: The IRS must show clear and convincing evidence, a higher standard than negligence but lower than the criminal threshold of beyond a reasonable doubt.

If the IRS successfully establishes civil fraud, the resulting monetary penalty can be substantial. Additionally, the presence of civil fraud may increase the risk of criminal investigation.

---

### Criminal Penalties for Taxpayers

While civil penalties primarily involve monetary fines, criminal penalties address willful and fraudulent acts. Criminal convictions can result in substantial fines, imprisonment, or both. These typically involve the Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecution with the IRS providing investigative support.

#### Tax Evasion

• Statutory Basis: IRC §7201.  
• Definition: Willful attempt to evade or defeat a tax. This is often evidenced by affirmative acts of concealment or deception.  
• Possible Punishment: Up to five years in prison, fines up to $100,000 for individuals ($500,000 for corporations), and the cost of prosecution.

#### Willful Failure to File a Return

• Statutory Basis: IRC §7203.  
• Definition: Willfully failing to file a tax return on time, even if no tax is owed.  
• Possible Punishment: Up to one year of imprisonment, plus fines and the costs of prosecution.

#### Filing a False Return (Tax Perjury)

• Statutory Basis: IRC §7206(1).  
• Definition: Willfully making and subscribing to a tax return that the filer does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter.  
• Possible Punishment: Up to three years in prison, monetary fines, or both.

Criminal tax charges typically arise when there is clear evidence of deliberate misconduct. Examples include keeping two sets of books, using secret bank accounts, or falsifying invoices to reduce the tax liability.

### Distinguishing Negligence from Fraud

A common question is how the IRS draws a line between civil negligence and civil fraud, and by extension, between civil fraud and criminal tax evasion. The key factor is the taxpayer’s state of mind:

• Negligence: Lack of due care, ordinary negligence, or disregard of rules. No intent to deceive or defraud.  
• Fraud: Knowing or intentional violation of legal duty. Conduct indicates an attempt to mislead, conceal, or evade tax.  

Although negligence may lead to civil penalties, it does not carry the stigma or severity of fraud. Fraud typically requires deception, such as forging financial records or consistently omitting income intentionally. Once the IRS identifies patterns suggesting deception, audits can escalate to civil fraud or even a criminal referral.

### Potential Penalty Mitigations and Defenses

Taxpayers can sometimes mitigate or avoid certain penalties by demonstrating:

1. Reasonable Cause: Showing that the cause for the error or late filing was due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer’s control, coupled with good faith efforts to comply (e.g., serious illness, reliance on a competent tax adviser).  
2. Substantial Authority: Being able to cite credible authority (Treasury Regulations, pertinent case law, IRS rulings) for a tax position, reducing or removing accuracy-related penalties.  
3. Reliance on Professional Advice: Establishing that the taxpayer relied in good faith on a competent tax professional’s guidance, provided all relevant information was furnished.  

Timing is critical. If the taxpayer can demonstrate they took prompt corrective actions—such as amending the return or paying the balance—before an audit or IRS notification, the IRS may show leniency.

### Practical Case Study

John, a small business owner, faces additional tax liability after an IRS audit reveals unreported income from John’s side activities. John had relied on a friend (with no formal accounting background) to prepare his returns. The IRS determines John’s case involves negligence because he failed to maintain adequate books and records, but no evidence suggests he intentionally hid income.

• Likely Outcome: John may be subject to a 20% negligence penalty under §6662 plus interest. If, however, the examiner found emails showing John actively coaching the friend to omit certain transactions, the penalty could escalate to a 75% civil fraud penalty. If those emails were extremely incriminating—indicating John falsified records—a criminal referral might occur, possibly leading to prosecution for tax evasion.

### Best Practices to Avoid Civil and Criminal Penalties

1. Maintain Adequate Records. Accurate and comprehensive documentation (invoices, receipts, financial statements) helps you withstand audits and defend your tax positions.  
2. Disclose Uncertain Positions. Use Form 8275 or 8275-R to disclose uncertain tax positions. This may avoid accuracy-related penalties if you have a reasonable basis.  
3. Seek Professional Advice. Engage reputable CPAs or attorneys for complex tax matters.  
4. File Timely and Accurately. Request automatic extensions if needed, but be aware of payment obligations that remain due by the original deadline.  
5. Proactive Corrections. If you discover an error, file an amended return promptly. This may prevent or reduce penalties.

### Diagram: Civil vs. Criminal Penalty Escalation

The following diagram illustrates how a taxpayer’s case may escalate from routine civil inquiries to potential criminal investigations if certain indicators of fraud or willfulness come to light:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A["Routine Tax Audit <br/> (Verification of Return)"] --> B["Suspicion of Inaccuracy <br/> (Negligence or Error)"]
    B["Suspicion of Inaccuracy <br/> (Negligence or Error)"] --> C["Escalation to Possible Civil Fraud <br/> (75% Penalty)"]
    C["Escalation to Possible Civil Fraud <br/> (75% Penalty)"] --> D["Referral to Criminal Investigation <br/> (DOJ Prosecution)"]
```

If the IRS initially discovers basic errors (B), they may impose standard civil penalties. But if their investigation uncovers willful deception or patterns of misconduct, the case can escalate to civil fraud (C). Ultimately, if there is sufficient evidence of criminal conduct, the IRS can refer the case to the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) for prosecution (D).

Best practices, diligent recordkeeping, and ethical behavior go a long way toward avoiding penalty disputes with the IRS. While mistakes can happen, informed taxpayers and professionals who take prompt corrective measures are far less likely to face significant – or escalated – penalties. Ultimately, understanding the differences between negligence, fraud, and criminal conduct helps CPAs and their clients navigate the complexities of the tax system with greater confidence and security.
