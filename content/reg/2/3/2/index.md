## 3.2 Duties and Restrictions for Tax Practitioners

In the realm of taxation and regulation, tax practitioners hold positions of trust and responsibility. Clients expect them to navigate laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines to prepare and file accurate returns while safeguarding confidential information. Understanding the duties and restrictions outlined in federal regulations and professional standards not only ensures compliance but also fosters client confidence and personal accountability. This section delves into these key areas, focusing on signing returns, maintaining client confidentiality, and avoiding conflicts of interest.

Tax professionals—encompassing CPAs, Enrolled Agents (EAs), attorneys, and unlicensed preparers—must abide by an array of governing rules, chief among them Treasury Department Circular 230 (see also Chapter 3.1, “Treasury Department Circular 230”), state boards of accountancy regulations, and the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct. In this chapter, we examine essential duties, present relevant examples, discuss best practices, and highlight potential pitfalls with real-world scenarios.

### Overview of Core Duties and Restrictions

Tax practitioners are entrusted with a wide range of responsibilities. While regulations and guidelines vary based on practitioner type and jurisdiction, certain universal themes emerge:

• Diligence in return preparation and submission.  
• Proper signing of returns and claim forms.  
• Adherence to confidentiality and privacy requirements.  
• Disclosure when conflicts of interest arise.  
• Ongoing compliance with ethical guidelines under Circular 230 and state laws.  

Let us break down these critical points in greater detail.

### Signing Returns and Related Filing Requirements

One of the fundamental duties of tax practitioners is the proper signing of returns. Failure to comply can subject the practitioner to monetary and disciplinary sanctions. According to the IRS, any individual who prepares or substantially assists in preparing a tax return for compensation must sign the return as the paid preparer. Practitioners also need to include the Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN).

#### Legal Foundation
• Internal Revenue Code (IRC) §6695 imposes penalties for failing to sign.  
• Treasury Department Circular 230, Subpart B, outlines a practitioner’s duties to provide accurate information and sign returns where applicable.

#### Practical Example
Imagine a small CPA firm where multiple staff accountants assist in preparing a complex business return. The staff accountant who has the primary responsibility for the return must sign it as the preparer and include their PTIN. If this staff accountant neglects to sign the return or fails to include the PTIN, the firm could face monetary penalties, and the accountant might be subject to further disciplinary action from the IRS.

#### Best Practices
• Always confirm that the person principally responsible for preparing the return signs and includes their PTIN.  
• Maintain a system of quality control and internal review to prevent missing signatures or PTIN omissions.  
• Document all client interactions, ensuring clarity regarding who is responsible for finalizing the return.

### Maintaining Client Confidentiality and Privacy

Safeguarding client information is paramount for tax practitioners. This obligation arises from multiple sources: federal statutes (e.g., IRC §7216 on tax return preparer confidentiality), state accountancy boards, and professional bodies such as the AICPA.

#### Key Aspects of Confidentiality
1. Prohibition on Unauthorized Disclosure: Practitioners may not share tax return information with unauthorized parties unless explicitly permitted by law or unless the client provides written consent.  
2. Secure Storage of Records: Practitioners must store documents, both physical and electronic, in secure facilities or platforms to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.  
3. Limited Use of Client Information: Use of client data for marketing products or services without permission can violate IRC §7216, triggering significant penalties.  

#### Real-World Scenario
A CPA, hired to prepare an individual’s personal tax return, discovers the taxpayer owns various foreign investments requiring specialized forms (e.g., Form 8938 for Foreign Financial Assets). The CPA must handle these disclosures with the highest level of confidentiality, carefully ensuring no sensitive data is disclosed outside the course of compliance or to third parties without explicit client authorization. If the CPA used the client’s personal data to pitch unrelated financial products, this would violate confidentiality regulations and risk substantial penalties.

#### Practical Safeguards
• Encrypt client data and store it on secure servers or locked files accessible only to authorized personnel.  
• Obtain client consent in writing before sharing any tax information with third-party advisors (e.g., investment managers, lawyers).  
• Implement comprehensive staff training on data privacy laws, focusing on best practices for communications (e.g., email encryption).

### Avoiding Conflicts of Interest

A conflict of interest arises when a tax practitioner’s loyalties become divided, potentially influencing their ability to represent a client fairly and objectively. The most common conflicts occur when a practitioner represents multiple parties with diverging interests or has a personal (financial or non-financial) interest that could impair independence.

#### Circular 230 on Conflicts of Interest
Under Circular 230, practitioners must either refrain from representation or disclose the conflict to the affected clients, obtaining informed consent in writing. The practitioner should also evaluate whether they can competently and diligently represent all impacted clients. If not, withdrawal from the engagement may be necessary.

#### Illustrative Example
• Practitioner representing a partnership and, simultaneously, one of the partners personally. A dispute arises over allocation of partnership profits. If the practitioner continues to represent both entities, they risk appearing biased and could inadvertently breach duties of confidentiality.  
• CPA working as both corporate accountant and personal financial planner for the CEO. Tax-saving strategies for the CEO might conflict with the corporation’s best interest and could cast doubt on the CPA's independence.

#### Best Practices in Conflict Management
• Screen clients carefully during intake and maintain rigorous documentation regarding potential overlapping interests.  
• Obtain detailed conflict waivers and ensure that each client fully understands the implications of joint representation.  
• If conflict escalates, consider referring one or all parties to another qualified practitioner to preserve integrity and objectivity.

### Diagram: Ethical Duties Workflow

Below is a simple Mermaid diagram illustrating the flow of ethical decision-making when considering the duties and restrictions of a tax practitioner. The diagram highlights the interconnected facets that must be addressed before engaging or continuing an engagement.

```mermaid

    A["Engagement Request <br/>From Client"] --> B["Check for Conflicts <br/>Of Interest"];
    B -- No Potential Conflict --> C["Obtain Client Information <br/>& Documents"];
    B -- Potential Conflict --> D["Disclose Conflict <br/>& Seek Written Consent"];

    F --> G["Review & Sign <br/>Return"];
    G --> H["Securely Store <br/>Client Data"];
    H --> I["File Return & <br/>Maintain Records"];
```

1. A client approaches the practitioner with an engagement request.  
2. The practitioner checks for any conflicts of interest.  
3. If a conflict is found, the practitioner discloses it and seeks written consent or withdraws if consent is not provided.  
4. The practitioner, once satisfied that conflicts have been managed, obtains client documents and prepares returns.  
5. The practitioner securely stores all data throughout the process and ensures the return is signed and filed appropriately.

### Potential Penalties and Disciplinary Actions

Various regulations stipulate penalties and disciplinary measures for not adhering to required duties:

• Civil Penalties under IRC §6695 (Failure to sign returns or include PTIN, failure to furnish copy of return to taxpayer, etc.).  
• Criminal Penalties under IRC §7206 or §7216 if confidentiality or privacy laws are intentionally violated.  
• Suspension or disbarment from practice before the IRS under Circular 230 provisions.  
• State Board of Accountancy Actions (e.g., license suspension, revocation) for violating state regulations.  

---

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

• Missed Deadlines and Failure to Sign: One of the most obvious—but surprisingly frequent—oversight is failing to sign the return or missing critical deadlines for client filings.  
• Misunderstanding the Scope of Confidentiality: Using client data for marketing or disclosing it to family members, even innocently, can result in a breach.  
• Overextension of Services: Attempting to represent multiple parties with conflicting interests without obtaining written consent or adequately analyzing the conflict.  

#### Strategies to Overcome Pitfalls
• Implement a tracking calendar or online practice management system that provides alerts for signing returns and filing due dates.  
• Regularly review privacy policies with staff and update staff training modules on data security.  
• Draft detailed engagement letters and conflict-of-interest documents, requiring signatures from all parties.

### Case Study: Joint Representation Conflict

Consider a CPA firm that prepares tax returns for a married couple. Halfway through the year, the couple decides to divorce. Since the CPA firm has previously managed the couple’s joint interests, the separation raises immediate conflict-of-interest issues. The CPA must evaluate whether continuing to represent both parties is feasible without jeopardizing confidentiality or objectivity. If continuing representation of both is unrealistic, the CPA might need to either obtain conflict waivers (if both parties consent and the representation remains feasible) or withdraw from representing one or both parties entirely.

Key takeaways:
• Timely identification of a conflict is essential.  
• Full disclosure to both parties ensures transparency.  
• Written consent is required if representation continues.  
• If representation cannot remain fully objective, disengagement is the safest route.

### Additional Recommendations for Compliance

1. Develop a Comprehensive Procedures Manual.  
   - Include checklists for client intake processes, conflict checks, return preparation procedures, and final sign-offs.  
2. Maintain Rigorous Quality Control.  
   - Use review systems and peer checks to verify that staff consistently apply signing, confidentiality, and conflict-of-interest protocols.  
3. Stay Updated with Regulations.  
   - Monitor changes to Circular 230, IRS notices, and state accountancy rules. Conduct regular continuing professional education (CPE) sessions to ensure that you and your staff remain current.  
4. Invest in Secure Technology.  
   - Adopt secure portals for client file transfers, encrypt communications, and regularly back up client data.
