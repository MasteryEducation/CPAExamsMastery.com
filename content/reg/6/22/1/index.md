## 22.1 Qualifying as a Tax-Exempt Organization (501(c)(3))

In the U.S. tax system, Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code provides an avenue for organizations to gain favorable tax treatment when they serve the public good. Achieving this status can help nonprofits boost their credibility, secure funding, and align with specific legal requirements. This classification is typically granted to entities with charitable, religious, educational, or related missions, so long as several structural and operational tests are met. This section explores the key requirements for qualification, including the necessary organizing documents, the mandatory operational tests, and the ongoing filing obligations.

This content complements other chapters in this book, particularly Chapter 22’s broader discussion on tax-exempt entities (Sections 22.2 to 22.3) and references in Chapter 5: Federal Tax Procedures. A solid understanding of these chapters will help red-flag issues before applying for and maintaining tax-exempt status.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview of 501(c)(3) Classification

Organizations recognized under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) are exempt from federal income tax on activities related to their exempt purposes. Additionally, individuals and corporations that make donations to these entities can typically claim tax deductions, subject to certain limitations. Common 501(c)(3) entities include:

• Charitable organizations  
• Religious organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, mosques)  
• Educational institutions  
• Scientific research institutions  
• Literary societies  
• Organizations focused on public safety testing  
• Groups that foster amateur sports competitions  
• Organizations involved in national or international prevention of cruelty to animals or children  

To qualify, a nonprofit must pass two critical hurdles imposed by the IRS:

• The Organizational Test  
• The Operational Test  

Both tests aim to ensure that the entity is structured and operated in a manner consistent with its stated charitable or otherwise exempt purposes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Importance of Organizing Documents

When forming a 501(c)(3), it is vital to choose the right legal structure (e.g., corporation, trust, or association). Each structure requires specific organizing documents, such as articles of incorporation (for a corporation) or a trust agreement (for a trust). The IRS considers these documents to confirm the entity’s charitable intent, enforce restrictions on the distribution of assets, and ensure compliance with exemption rules.

#### Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws

In most states, articles of incorporation must include:

• A clear statement of the organization’s exempt purpose(s): Charitable, religious, educational, or any combination recognized under Section 501(c)(3).  
• A statement restricting the organization from engaging in activities that do not further its exempt purpose(s).  
• A provision ensuring that upon dissolution, any remaining assets must be distributed to another 501(c)(3) organization or a governmental entity.  
• A clause embodying the prohibition on private inurement, preventing insiders (e.g., directors, officers, key employees) from benefiting improperly from the organization’s revenue.  

In addition to the articles of incorporation, corporate bylaws outline internal rules and often include:

• Membership and governance structure  
• Voting rights of board members  
• Details on board meetings, officer elections, and quorums  
• Conflict of interest policies and other governance considerations  

#### Example of a Dissolution Clause

A typical dissolution clause for a 501(c)(3) might read:  
“Upon the dissolution of this corporation, assets shall be distributed for one or more exempt purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or shall be distributed to the federal government or to a state or local government for a public purpose.”

Failure to include an adequate dissolution clause is a common pitfall that can jeopardize tax-exempt status. Organizations must make sure that any amendments to the organizing documents remain consistent with the requirements under Section 501(c)(3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Organizational Test

The organizational test is the first threshold. It evaluates whether the legal paperwork—articles of incorporation, trust agreements, association charters—limit the organization’s purpose to those recognized under Section 501(c)(3). The organizing documents must:

• Explicitly state an exempt purpose (charitable, religious, educational, etc.).  
• Prohibit any non-exempt activities that materially deviate from that stated purpose.  
• Clearly stipulate that net earnings will not benefit private individuals or shareholders.  
• Contain a dissolution provision dedicating assets to exempt purposes if the organization folds.  

If an organization’s paperwork does not explicitly restrict its purposes to activities recognized under Section 501(c)(3), the IRS will almost certainly deny exemption. The entity can file amended articles, but any operational misconduct before or during the submission process can still trigger additional scrutiny.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Operational Test

Merely including the right language in the organizing documents is not sufficient. The IRS also examines how the organization operates day to day. The operational test checks if the entity’s activities truly align with its declared charitable or other exempt purposes. Key metrics include:

• Conduct of Activities: The extent to which time and resources are devoted to exempt functions must be substantial.  
• Private Inurement Prohibition: The organization must not allow any insiders—board members, officers, or major donors—to receive unreasonably high compensation or other undue benefits.  
• Lobbying and Political Activity Restrictions: A 501(c)(3) can engage in some lobbying (within defined limits), but any direct or indirect participation in political campaigns for or against a candidate is strictly prohibited.  
• Commercial Activity: The organization may engage in certain revenue-generating activities so long as they substantially further the exempt purpose, or if they are insubstantial in relation to the organization’s overall exempt activities. (Unrelated business income might be subject to UBIT, discussed further in Chapter 22.3.)  

#### Private Inurement vs. Private Benefit

• Private Inurement: Occurs when an “insider” of the organization—such as a director or officer—receives benefits beyond reasonable compensation. This can lead to revocation of tax-exempt status.  
• Private Benefit: The organization’s activities must benefit a broad charitable class or the general public rather than specifically benefiting private individuals. Incidental private benefits might be acceptable, but they should not be the primary purpose of the organization’s activity.  

Failing the operational test is one of the fastest ways to lose 501(c)(3) status. The IRS remains vigilant for organizations abusing their charitable label for personal or political gain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding Public Charities vs. Private Foundations

Most 501(c)(3) organizations operate as either “public charities” or “private foundations.” When seeking exemption under 501(c)(3), you must understand these distinctions:

• Public Charities: Receive broad support from various sources, such as the general public or government grants. Examples include churches, universities, hospitals, and large charitable organizations like the American Red Cross.  
• Private Foundations: Typically funded by a single individual, family, or corporate entity. They often make grants to other charities rather than run their own programs. Examples include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  

Public charities must meet certain public support tests to avoid defaulting into private foundation status, which carries additional rules and excise taxes (discussed in detail in Chapter 22.2).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Filing Requirements for a 501(c)(3) Organization

To officially secure federal tax-exempt status, an organization generally must file Form 1023 (or the streamlined Form 1023-EZ, if eligible) with the IRS. Below is an outline of essential filing obligations:

1. **Form 1023 Application (or Form 1023-EZ):**  
   • Must provide detailed information regarding the organization’s structure, finances, activities, and governance.  
   • Includes narratives describing programs and how they further the organization’s exempt purpose.  
   • Discloses information about founders, governing board composition, and compensation arrangements.  
   • Requires submission of organizing documents (articles of incorporation, bylaws, trust documents).  

2. **Timing of Filing:**  
   • A new organization typically should file Form 1023 within 27 months after the end of the month in which it was legally formed to enjoy retroactive recognition of exempt status.  
   • Late filing can cause the effective date of exemption to begin on the postmark date rather than the date of formation, affecting deductibility of donations received in the interim.

3. **Determination Letter:**  
   • Once the IRS approves the application, the organization will receive a determination letter, confirming its tax-exempt status and classification as a public charity or private foundation.  

4. **Annual Filing (Form 990 Series):**  
   • Public charities must file Form 990, 990-EZ, or 990-N (e-Postcard) annually, depending on their gross receipts and assets.  
   • Private foundations must file Form 990-PF.  
   • Failure to file for three consecutive years leads to automatic revocation of exempt status.  

Please note that certain religious organizations, such as churches and exclusively religious activities, are automatically recognized as exempt without having to file Form 1023. However, filing can be beneficial to obtain a formal determination letter, often required by donors and some state-level agencies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example: Local Animal Rescue Organization

To illustrate how these steps come together, consider a hypothetical scenario:

• A group of volunteers creates “Pets First Rescue,” a nonprofit seeking to rehabilitate abandoned animals.  
• They form a nonprofit corporation with the state, drafting articles of incorporation (including a prohibition on private inurement and a dissolution clause).  
• The articles indicate a primary exempt purpose: preventing cruelty to animals, which is a recognized 501(c)(3) function.  
• Pets First Rescue’s board adopts bylaws detailing meetings, officer roles, and conflict-of-interest policies.  
• Within six months of incorporation, they file Form 1023 with the IRS. The application clearly explains how the organization’s rescue and adoption programs further its exempt charitable objectives and includes financial projections.  
• After approval, the IRS issues a determination letter. Pets First Rescue then files annual Form 990-N because its gross receipts are below the threshold for Form 990 or 990-EZ.  
• The organization diligently ensures no board member receives unreasonable compensation, fulfilling the private inurement prohibition, thereby meeting both the organizational and operational tests.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Operational Test in Practice: Political Activity and Lobbying

As mentioned, a section 501(c)(3) organization may engage in some lobbying but must be careful not to exceed certain safe-harbor limits. Political campaign activity, however, is altogether banned. Any noncompliance—like endorsing a specific candidate—can invite monetary penalties or even the loss of exemption.

#### Lobbying Limits

Several methods exist to measure lobbying expenditures. One popular approach is filing Form 5768 to make the Section 501(h) election, which offers bright-line expenditure limits. If an organization does not make this election, the IRS may measure lobbying activities based on whether they are “substantial,” a more subjective metric that can create risk and uncertainty. For more in-depth discussion on lobbying, see Chapter 10 (Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Business), which explains how the tax code and federal statutes can limit or penalize improper lobbying and political contributions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Maintaining Compliance: Unrelated Business Income

While 501(c)(3) organizations may engage in certain revenue-generating activities related to their tax-exempt purposes, they must pay attention to Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) on net income from unrelated commercial activities. Chapter 22.3 details UBIT, but here are the basics:

• Unrelated Business Income (UBI) arises from regularly carried-on trade or business activities not substantially related to the organization’s exempt mission.  
• The organization must file Form 990-T if UBI meets or exceeds IRS threshold amounts.  
• Excessive UBI could jeopardize exempt status, especially if it hints that the nonprofit is primarily a commercial entity rather than a charitable institution.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

1. **Drafting Clear Mission and Bylaws**  
   • Ensure mission statements match a recognized exempt purpose.  
   • Use unambiguous language around asset distribution upon dissolution.  
   • Adopt a conflict-of-interest policy as part of the bylaws.

2. **Conducting Ongoing Compliance Reviews**  
   • Have periodic board meetings to oversee operations and review financial statements.  
   • Document compensation decisions for key personnel to avoid allegations of private inurement.

3. **Avoiding Excessive Private Benefit**  
   • Vet relationships with vendors and partner organizations.  
   • Ensure family members or close associates are not paid beyond market value for their services.

4. **Reporting Consistent Financial Information**  
   • Coordinate with tax professionals (refer to Chapter 5 on Federal Tax Procedures) to avoid errors on annual returns.  
   • Fix mistakes quickly if discovered in annual Form 990, with appropriate disclosures to the IRS.

5. **Monitoring Lobbying Activities**  
   • Consider making the 501(h) election if the organization expects significant advocacy or lobbying efforts.  
   • Keep up with changes in lobbying regulations and track expenditures carefully.

6. **Underestimating UBIT**  
   • Properly segment any true charitable activities from commercial ventures.  
   • File Form 990-T and pay any resulting taxes promptly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Case Studies: Real-World Scenarios

• **Educational Nature Center**  
  A small nature center formed under state law primarily provides guided educational tours, which is a recognized 501(c)(3) purpose. However, the center also owns a gift shop selling unrelated souvenirs and snacks. The net revenue from the shop is subject to UBIT tax, but the organization’s main operation—educational tours—remains the exempt purpose. The center stays compliant by filing Form 990 and Form 990-T annually.

• **Quick-Fix Nonprofit**  
  An individual sets up a nonprofit to “advocate for social change” and immediately starts endorsing political candidates while paying themselves a large salary. Their articles and bylaws are incomplete, lacking any formal statement of charitable purpose or dissolution plan. They also fail to limit private inurement. The IRS denies their Form 1023 application because they fail both the organizational and operational tests. Moreover, their political activity disqualifies them from 501(c)(3) status.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Practical Tips for CPA Candidates

• Know the difference between the organizational and operational tests, as well as their implications.  
• Understand that all 501(c)(3) organizations must be formed and operated for recognized charitable, religious, or educational purposes, and must not distribute earnings to private individuals.  
• Work closely with professionals (attorneys, CPAs) to ensure that articles of incorporation and bylaws contain the mandatory clauses and statements.  
• Remain mindful of lobbying and political restrictions, as those complexities often appear in Regulation (REG) exam scenarios.  
• Reference Chapter 22.2 for detailed guidance on private foundations, a specialized subset likely to appear in exams and practice.
