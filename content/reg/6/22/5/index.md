## 22.5 Allocation of Income and Corpus; Distributable Net Income (DNI)

In trust and estate taxation, understanding how income is allocated between the fiduciary entity (the trust or estate) and the beneficiaries is crucial for compliance and optimal tax planning. Fiduciary accounting income (FAI) arises from traditional “income vs. principal” (also called “corpus”) rules, whereas tax rules hinge on concepts such as Distributable Net Income (DNI). In this section, we explore the framework under which interest, dividends, capital gains, and other receipts are allocated to either income or corpus, how trust documents and state law guide those allocations, and how tax regulations interpret or override these allocations for the purpose of computing DNI and beneficiary taxation. We also look at the relationship between fiduciary accounting income, distributions, and the taxable consequences for both the trust or estate and its beneficiaries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview of Fiduciary Accounting Income vs. Taxable Income

Though “fiduciary accounting income” is often governed by the trust instrument and state laws (e.g., the Uniform Principal and Income Act in many jurisdictions), the final taxable outcome for a trust or estate—and its beneficiaries—relies on federal tax law. A key separation is:

• Fiduciary Accounting Income (FAI) – Dictated by state law and the trust or estate’s governing document. It typically includes regular interest, dividends, rents, and other “income” streams, but it might exclude items such as capital gains or extraordinary receipts that are designated by statute or trust provisions as “principal” or “corpus.”  
• Taxable Income – Determined under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), particularly Subchapter J (Sections 641–692). Taxable income takes into account certain inclusions, exclusions, and deduction limitations that the trust or estate must apply separately from the state-based accounting approach.

This distinction is essential because a trust might show a certain amount of “accounting income,” but the same amounts might be classified, for federal tax purposes, as principal or capital gains. Additionally, certain deductible expenses under state law may or may not be deductible for tax purposes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Concepts in Allocation of Income and Corpus

1. Principal (Corpus) vs. Income  
   • Principal (or corpus) is generally considered the property that creates or increases the trust corpus—e.g., proceeds from the sale of trust assets, major capital gain events, certain extraordinary receipts.  
   • Income (or current income) includes dividends, interest, rent, royalties, and other routine items that do not deplete the underlying principal.

2. Governing Instrument and State Law  
   • The trust or estate’s governing instrument (will or trust agreement) often provides definitions and instructions regarding whether certain receipts are allocated to principal or income.  
   • Where the governing instrument is silent or ambiguous, state law (often based on the Uniform Principal and Income Act) provides default rules.

3. Adjustments per the Trust Document  
   • A trust instrument may permit or require adjustments to ensure fairness among income beneficiaries and remainder beneficiaries (those who receive the corpus at the trust’s termination).  
   • These adjustments might allow the trustee to reallocate certain items from principal to income or vice versa, reflecting modern investment practices and beneficiary expectations.

4. Personal vs. Business Expenses  
   • Expenses incurred by the trust or estate, such as administrative fees or advisory costs, can be charged proportionally to income and/or principal, as specified by the governing instrument or relevant state statute.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Distributable Net Income (DNI) – The Foundation of Taxation

DNI is a tax concept that determines the maximum amount of income on which beneficiaries can be taxed and, correspondingly, the deduction available to the trust or estate for distributions. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC §643) defines DNI with the objective of preventing double taxation—once at the trust level and once at the beneficiary level.

DNI typically includes:

• Gross income of the trust (including interest, dividends, certain capital gains if allocated to the beneficiary, rents, and income from pass-through entities)  
• Minus: Deductions allocable to that income (trustee fees, legal fees, state and local taxes, and other expenses)  
• Plus/Minus: Certain adjustments (tax-exempt interest, foreign taxes, extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends if allocated to corpus, etc.)

DNI sets the upper limit of what is “passed through” to beneficiaries for federal income tax purposes. Distributions that exceed DNI generally do not carry out additional taxable income to beneficiaries (though they can involve principal distributions or reallocated income items).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Practical Illustration of DNI Calculation

Consider the following simplified trust scenario for one tax year:

• Trust Income (Under Tax Rules and FAI):  
  – $20,000 in interest income  
  – $5,000 in qualified dividends  
  – $10,000 in capital gains (allocated to principal by the trust document)  
• Trust Expenses:  
  – $3,000 in fiduciary fees (allocated 50% to principal and 50% to income under state law)  
  – $2,000 in investment advisory fees (fully allocable to income)  

Step 1: Determine FAI  
• According to the trust document and state law, capital gains are allocated to principal and do not become part of fiduciary accounting income.  
• FAI = (Interest + Dividends) – (Expenses charged against income)  
• FAI = $(20,000 + 5,000) – [50% of $3,000 + $2,000]  
• FAI = $25,000 – $3,500 = $21,500

Step 2: Translate FAI to Taxable Income  
• For tax purposes, the capital gains might still be included in the trust’s gross income but remain allocated to principal. Thus, they may remain taxed at the trust level if not distributed.  
• Total Gross Income (Tax): $(20,000 + 5,000 + 10,000) = $35,000  
• Total Allowable Deductions (Tax):  
   – Fiduciary fees: $3,000 (allocated between corpus and income, but for tax, it might all be deductible subject to the proportion of taxable income vs. corpus)  
   – Investment advisory fees: $2,000

Step 3: Compute DNI  
• Capital gains, if allocated entirely to principal under the terms of the trust, are typically excluded from DNI unless specifically allocated for distribution to the beneficiary.  
• Therefore, for DNI, we might exclude the $10,000 in capital gains.  
• DNI = (Interest + Dividends) – (Expenses allocable to those items) = $25,000 – $3,500 = $21,500  

Note: The exact allocation of expenses to income vs. principal for tax purposes can be more intricate, as state law, trust documents, and applicable tax regulations must be consulted. However, this simple example demonstrates how capital gains allocated to corpus typically remain excluded from DNI unless the trust document explicitly allocates them to the income beneficiary or the trustee chooses to do so.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Distribution to Beneficiaries and Tax Implications

For a trust or estate, distributions up to DNI shift taxable income to the beneficiaries. Here’s the typical sequence:

1. Simple Trusts  
   • Must distribute all fiduciary accounting income annually.  
   • Could have some principal or corpus retained if the trust instrument does not require distribution of corpus.  
   • Beneficiaries are taxed on the income they receive (to the extent of DNI).  
   • The trust receives a deduction for distributions up to DNI, avoiding double taxation.

2. Complex Trusts  
   • May accumulate income, distribute corpus, or make discretionary distributions.  
   • The trust is taxed on any undistributed income.  
   • Beneficiaries are taxed on the portion of trust income actually distributed (again, up to DNI).  
   • A complex trust can also make charitable contributions and might retain some portion of its income.

3. Estates  
   • Similar rules for DNI apply to estates. The estate can claim a deduction for distributions to beneficiaries of income.  
   • Estate beneficiaries report the distributions as income in their personal returns.

4. Capital Gains  
   • Typically taxed at the trust level unless specifically allocated to beneficiaries.  
   • Under certain circumstances, the trust instrument or trustee may include capital gains in DNI if the governing instrument or local law treats them as distributable income.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Interaction Between Fiduciary Accounting Income and Distributable Net Income

Although fiduciary accounting income (FAI) and DNI are distinct concepts, they overlap significantly. The sequence often looks like this:

• A trust receives gross income.  
• Allocation to principal vs. income occurs under state law or the trust document, resulting in FAI.  
• Tax adjustments (like depreciation, tax-exempt interest, foreign tax credits, capital gains, or other adjustments) are made to FAI to determine DNI for tax reporting.  
• Distributions to beneficiaries “carry out” income for tax purposes up to the DNI limit.

It is important for fiduciaries to keep accurate records for both accounting (FAI) and tax (DNI) purposes. Errors in allocating receipts and expenses between principal and income may lead to an incorrect calculation of distributions, beneficiary shares, and fiduciary tax liability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Determining Whether Capital Gains Are Part of DNI

One of the most challenging aspects of trust taxation is deciding whether capital gains are included in DNI. Although capital gains are typically allocated to principal for both accounting and tax purposes, there are a few exceptions:

• The trust instrument or local law requires that capital gains be treated as income.  
• The trustee exercises a power to adjust or a discretionary power under state law (or the trust document) to treat part of the gain as distributed to the beneficiaries.  
• The capital gain is required to be distributed to the beneficiary under the trust’s terms.

If any of these exceptions apply and the capital gains are considered distributable income for beneficiaries, those gains may be included in DNI, thus “carrying out” that portion of gain to the beneficiary’s return.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Diagram: Flow of Trust Income to Beneficiaries

```

In this flow, capital gains and other extraordinary proceeds are often directed to corpus (F in the diagram), while routine interest, dividends, and certain other receipts move toward DNI (D) and eventually flow out to beneficiaries (E).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Special Case: Tier System of Distributions

The trust code historically applied a “tier system,” under which:

• First tier: Distributions of income mandated by the trust (for simple trusts, typically all FAI).  
• Second tier: All other distributions of income or corpus.

Under more recent regulations, the emphasis lies primarily on whether the trust or estate is simple vs. complex rather than strictly applying the tiers. Nonetheless, the concept that trust principal distributions are generally not taxed to beneficiaries (unless they carry out DNI, such as being designated as capital gains that are included in DNI) remains important.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Best Practices for Trustees and Tax Professionals

1. Maintain Comprehensive Records  
   • Separate bank accounts or subledgers can track income and corpus to reduce confusion.  
   • Document rationale for any discretionary reallocation or adjustments.

2. Thoroughly Review Trust Documents  
   • Be aware of any unique provisions for allocating capital gains, extraordinary dividends, or expenses.  
   • Cross-check these provisions with state law requirements.

3. Consult State Uniform Principal and Income Act  
   • Many states have adopted versions of the Uniform Principal and Income Act, which spell out default rules if the instrument is silent.  
   • Verify any state-specific modifications or disclaimers.

4. Coordinate with Tax Professionals  
   • Tax regulations for DNI can differ from fiduciary accounting rules, requiring specialized expertise.  
   • A small misallocation could lead to significant tax liabilities or missed opportunities for the trust or beneficiaries.

5. Communicate with Beneficiaries  
   • Transparency regarding how and why income vs. principal allocations are made can reduce disputes and align expectations.  
   • Clarify distributions for tax and accounting purposes to help beneficiaries plan for their individual tax liabilities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Common Pitfalls and Challenges

• Misalignment Between Governing Instrument and Tax Rules  
  – Trustees sometimes rely solely on the trust’s accounting rules without addressing federal tax limitations or benefits. This can result in over-distribution or misclassification of income.

• Overlooking Capital Gains Inclusion  
  – Some trust documents may allow or require capital gains to be distributable to beneficiaries. Trust administrators who overlook this can produce inaccurate beneficiary K-1s and cause misreporting of tax liability.

• Incorrect Expense Allocations  
  – Expenses incorrectly allocated between income and principal can skew the DNI calculation. This error may be especially relevant when expenses relate to both income and principal assets (e.g., a trustee commission, legal fees related to the defense of trust assets, or property repairs).

• Failing to Adapt to State-Specific Law Amendments  
  – Not all states adopt the Uniform Principal and Income Act identically. Amendments, exceptions, or older versions may lead to confusion unless carefully researched.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Real-World Example: Simple Trust with Distribution Requirements

Assume a basic (simple) trust, required to distribute all of its income annually to a single beneficiary:

• Trust receives $50,000 in interest income.  
• Trust receives $10,000 in capital gains, allocated to principal per the trust instrument.  
• Fiduciary fees are $5,000 (allocated 60% to income and 40% to principal).  

Fiduciary Accounting Income (FAI) for the year:  
• Income = $50,000  
• Expense to income portion = $3,000  
• FAI = $47,000  

To determine Distributable Net Income (DNI), we begin with the trust’s taxable income. If the $10,000 of capital gains remains in corpus (and trust document/state law do not treat it as distributable income), it’s excluded from DNI. The trust’s gross income for tax is $60,000 ($50,000 + $10,000), but we exclude the $10,000 capital gain from DNI. Then deduct $3,000 of fees applicable to income. Thus, DNI ends up mirroring the FAI for that year, $47,000, which must be distributed to the beneficiary. The beneficiary then reports the $47,000 as income on their personal return, and the trust pays tax on only the $10,000 capital gain retained in principal (subject to applicable capital gains rates if not otherwise distributed).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Looking Ahead and Continuous Learning

Allocation of income and corpus, alongside the calculation of DNI, remains a cornerstone of trust and estate taxation. Ongoing changes in federal and state legislation, as well as the complex interplay between state fiduciary rules and federal tax law, create a dynamic environment for trustees, beneficiaries, and practitioners. Familiarity with the relevant statutes—such as IRC §§641–663, Treasury Regulations, Revenue Rulings, and local trust laws—will help ensure correct application of these principles.

## Master Your Knowledge of Fiduciary Accounting and DNI: Quiz on Trust Income Allocation

{{< quizdown >}}

### In trust accounting, principal (or corpus) generally includes:
- [ ] Interest and dividends  
- [ ] Qualifying dividends and tax-exempt bond interest  
- [x] Proceeds from the sale of trust assets  
- [ ] Routine rental payments  

> **Explanation:** Proceeds from the sale of trust assets are ordinarily allocated to principal (corpus). Regular interest, dividends, and rental income are usually considered income unless the trust instrument or state law specifies otherwise.

### Which of the following best describes “Distributable Net Income (DNI)”?
- [ ] The total income reported on the trust’s financial statements  
- [x] The upper limit of income that can be “passed through” to beneficiaries for tax purposes  
- [ ] The net of capital gains minus trustee fees  
- [ ] The final tax on net estate assets at liquidation  

> **Explanation:** DNI is a tax concept that caps the maximum amount of trust or estate income that beneficiaries can be taxed on, preventing double taxation. It differs from mere financial or fiduciary accounting income.

### When capital gains are allocated to corpus and not distributed to beneficiaries:
- [x] The trust typically pays tax on those gains  
- [ ] The beneficiary includes these gains in current income  
- [ ] The gains never factor into the trust’s tax return  
- [ ] The gains are excluded from both trust and beneficiary tax returns  

> **Explanation:** If the trust instrument allocates capital gains to corpus and does not distribute them, they are usually taxed within the trust. They do not flow through to the beneficiary as part of DNI.

### Which document primarily governs the allocation of trust receipts between principal and income?
- [x] The trust instrument (governing document) and applicable state law  
- [ ] The Internal Revenue Code only  
- [ ] IRS Publication 525  
- [ ] Treasurer’s Notice of Balance  

> **Explanation:** While federal tax law controls taxation, the trust instrument and state laws (often through the Uniform Principal and Income Act) dictate how receipts and expenditures are allocated between income and corpus.

### A simple trust is characterized by which of the following?
- [x] It must distribute all fiduciary accounting income annually  
- [ ] It can accumulate income at the trustee’s discretion  
- [x] It cannot make charitable contributions  
- [ ] It is dissolved after one year  

> **Explanation:** By definition, a simple trust must distribute all of its income each year and generally cannot make charitable contributions (complex trusts can). It is not required to distribute corpus on a set schedule unless specified by the trust instrument.

### If a trust’s DNI is $30,000 and it distributes $20,000 in the current year, how much is generally deducted from the trust’s taxable income?
- [x] $20,000  
- [ ] $30,000  
- [ ] $10,000  
- [ ] $0  

> **Explanation:** The trust is allowed a deduction up to the amount actually distributed, not exceeding DNI. Therefore, in this scenario, $20,000 is deducted on the trust’s return.

### Which category below is least likely to be included in fiduciary accounting income?
- [ ] Interest from savings accounts  
- [ ] Routine dividends  
- [x] Capital improvements to trust property  
- [ ] Rental income  

> **Explanation:** Capital improvements to trust property typically come from principal or corpus. Interest, dividends, and rental income usually become part of fiduciary accounting income.

### Under certain conditions, capital gains may be included in DNI when:
- [x] The trust document or state law allows capital gains to be treated as income  
- [ ] The trust has zero income in prior years  
- [ ] The trustee invests exclusively in government bonds  
- [ ] The trust is considered revocable by the grantor  

> **Explanation:** Capital gains can be part of DNI if the trust document or local law specifies that capital gains be allocated to income or distributed to beneficiaries, which effectively “carries out” the gain.

### An example of a trust expense that might be allocable to both income and principal is:
- [x] Trustee fees  
- [ ] Beneficiary personal expenses  
- [ ] State lottery tickets purchased by the trustee  
- [ ] Insurance proceeds received by the trust  

> **Explanation:** Trustee fees often benefit both the corpus (the overall trust) and the current income streams, so they may be split between income and principal according to the trust agreement or state law.

### A trustee’s failure to follow the trust instrument’s allocation rules to distribute income:
- [x] Can result in beneficiary disputes and potential litigation  
- [ ] Has no effect because federal law supersedes the trust instrument  
- [ ] Is permitted if it reduces the trust’s overall tax liability  
- [ ] Carries no negative consequences if compensated in the next tax year  

> **Explanation:** The trustee is legally obligated to act pursuant to the trust instrument’s instructions. Failure to do so can lead to conflicts, lawsuits, or penalties for breaching fiduciary duty.
