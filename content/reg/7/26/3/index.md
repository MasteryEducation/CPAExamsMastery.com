## 26.3 Use of Tax-Advantaged Accounts (HSAs, FSAs, Retirement)

Tax-advantaged accounts offer unique ways for individuals to reduce their current taxable income, postpone or eliminate certain taxes, and boost their overall financial well-being. This section explores Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), Flexible Spending Arrangements (FSAs), and various retirement plans such as 401(k)s, IRAs, and other employer-sponsored plans. By learning the fundamentals of contribution limits, catch-up provisions, and the interplay between these accounts and taxable income, you can help clients (or yourself) implement powerful tax and retirement strategies.

This discussion is closely connected to concepts in Chapter 15 (Adjustments, Deductions, and Credits) and aligns with the personal financial planning strategies covered in Chapter 27. Where appropriate, references are made to additional chapters for a deeper dive into relevant rules and planning opportunities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview of Tax-Advantaged Accounts

Tax-advantaged accounts generally offer one or more of the following benefits:

• Contributions made with pre-tax (or tax-deductible) dollars, lowering current taxable income.  
• Tax-deferred growth, meaning earnings are not taxed until distribution (or potentially never, in the case of HSAs used for qualified expenses and Roth-type accounts).  
• Tax-free withdrawals if used for qualifying expenses (e.g., qualified medical expenses, retirement distributions under specific conditions, or Roth accounts with qualified distributions).

Choosing and balancing these accounts can have a profound impact on your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and overall tax liability. Below is a holistic look at HSAs, FSAs, and retirement accounts, along with practical illustrations and key planning considerations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)

#### What Is an HSA?
A Health Savings Account (HSA) is a specialized, individually owned medical savings account available to taxpayers enrolled in a High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). HSAs offer a “triple tax advantage” when used correctly:  
1. Contributions are made on a pre-tax or tax-deductible basis.  
2. Any growth (e.g., interest, dividends, capital gains) accumulates tax-deferred.  
3. Distributions used for qualified medical expenses are tax-free.

#### Eligibility Requirements
To contribute to an HSA, an individual must:  
• Be covered under a qualifying HDHP (meeting specific minimum deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limits).  
• Not be eligible for or enrolled in Medicare.  
• Not be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return.  
• Have no other disqualifying health coverage (such as a general-purpose FSA through a spouse).

#### Contribution Limits
Annual HSA contribution limits—adjusted periodically for inflation—differ based on whether coverage is for an individual or family.  
• For example, if you have self-only HDHP coverage, your maximum contribution might be around $4,150 (hypothetical future figure) for the 2025 tax year.  
• Individuals with family coverage often have a higher limit, e.g., around $8,300 for 2025.  

▸ These figures change annually, so always confirm the latest IRS announcements.

#### Catch-Up Contributions
Individuals age 55 or older (but not yet enrolled in Medicare) are allowed to make an additional annual catch-up contribution—often $1,000. This extra amount can significantly accelerate HSA savings in the final decade before retirement.

#### Qualified Medical Expenses
Funds withdrawn for “qualified medical expenses” (as defined by the IRS, e.g., deductibles, copays, prescription drugs, certain dental/vision expenses) are entirely tax-free. If you use the funds for non-medical expenses prior to age 65, there is a 20% penalty plus ordinary income tax on the distribution. Once you reach age 65, non-medical distributions are subject only to ordinary income tax (no penalty), functioning similarly to a Traditional IRA.

#### Tax Benefits and Impact on Taxable Income
Because HSA contributions are either excluded from wages (if made through an employer’s cafeteria plan) or claimed as an “above-the-line” deduction (if independently contributed), HSA deposits reduce your AGI. This, in turn, can help taxpayers qualify for other credits, deductions, or income-based limitations.

Let us illustrate with a simple diagram showing how HSA contributions can reduce taxable income:

    B --> C["Reduced Taxable Income"]
    C --> D["Potentially Lower Overall Tax Liability"]
```

#### Common Pitfalls and Planning Strategies
• Failing to maintain HDHP coverage disqualifies you from contributing to the HSA, though you can still spend existing funds on qualified medical expenses.  
• Not tracking medical expenses properly can lead to inaccuracies in recordkeeping.  
• Using HSA funds for non-qualified expenses before age 65 results in steep penalties.  
• For healthy individuals with few medical expenses, an HSA can double as a “stealth IRA” by allowing tax-free accumulation of investment earnings for future medical (or post-65) retiree costs.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Flexible Spending Arrangements (FSAs)

#### Overview and Distinction from HSAs
FSAs come in two primary forms—Health FSAs and Dependent Care FSAs. Although they share certain similarities with HSAs (tax-deductible contributions and tax-free reimbursed expenses), FSAs differ in crucial respects, including “use it or lose it” provisions and their availability without needing an HDHP.

FSAs typically reduce taxable income by lowering gross wages subject to federal income tax, Social Security, and Medicare taxes. The maximum amounts are subject to annual inflation adjustments but often have lower caps compared to HSAs.

#### Health FSA
A Health FSA covers eligible healthcare costs, including copays, deductibles, select medical equipment, and other IRS-defined medical expenses.  

Contribution Limit Example:  
• For 2025 (hypothetical figure), employees might be able to withhold up to an estimated $3,150 in a Health FSA.  
• Funds generally must be used within the plan year (or a short grace period / limited carryover).

#### Dependent Care FSA
A Dependent Care FSA is geared toward childcare or dependent-care costs. Care for children under age 13, or adult dependents who cannot care for themselves, may be eligible.  

Contribution Limit Example:  
• Often capped at $5,000 for married filing jointly or single filers (subject to annual changes).  

Funds distributed from the Dependent Care FSA for qualified care are tax-free, but any amounts beyond the established limit become taxable.

#### Use-It-or-Lose-It Rule
A key limitation of FSAs is the “use it or lose it” requirement: funds not utilized for qualified expenses within the plan year (or grace period/carryover allowances, if allowed) are forfeited. Employers may offer:  
• A grace period of up to 2.5 months into the next year.  
• A carryover option (e.g., up to $610 or similar) for the next year.  

This mechanism encourages employees to estimate their medical or dependent care costs carefully.

#### Tax and Planning Considerations
• FSA contributions typically lower both federal income and FICA tax bases, yielding immediate tax savings.  
• FSAs do not have an investment component—unused amounts typically cannot be rolled into future years beyond limited sums or grace periods.  
• Precisely estimating annual medical or dependent care expenses is critical. Overestimations can lead to forfeitures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Retirement Accounts

A large portion of personal tax planning revolves around retirement accounts. Strategic contributions can reduce taxable income, encourage disciplined saving, and leverage employer-provided benefits. At distribution, the tax treatment depends on the account type (Traditional vs. Roth).

#### 1) Traditional IRA
A Traditional Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) allows taxpayers to contribute up to an annual limit (often indexed for inflation).  
• Contributions may be tax-deductible (subject to income limitations if covered by a workplace retirement plan).  
• Earnings grow tax-deferred.  
• Distributions are subject to ordinary income taxation (plus a 10% penalty if withdrawn before age 59½, unless an exception applies).  

Example Contribution Limits:  
• For 2025, an individual under age 50 might be allowed $7,000 annually, while those 50 or older can contribute an additional $1,000 as a catch-up. (These figures are illustrative and may be adjusted by actual IRS announcements.)

#### 2) Roth IRA
With a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified distributions (including investment gains) are tax-free.  
• There are modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) limits for eligibility to contribute directly to a Roth IRA.  
• Funds can be withdrawn tax-free after age 59½ if the account has been open at least five years (the “5-year rule”).  
• Roth IRAs carry no Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) for the original owner during their lifetime, making them attractive for estate planning.

#### 3) Employer-Sponsored Plans (401(k), 403(b), 457, etc.)
Employer-sponsored plans often permit more substantial contributions than IRAs. Additionally, many employers offer matching contributions, effectively providing free money to an employee’s retirement fund.

• 401(k) Plans:  
  – Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, lowering current taxable income.  
  – Roth 401(k) contributions use after-tax dollars, but qualified distributions are tax-free.  
  – Employer matches, if offered, are always pre-tax (i.e., taxed upon distribution).  
  – Contribution limit for younger workers might be around $22,500 for 2025, while participants age 50+ may add a catch-up contribution (e.g., $7,500).  

• 403(b) Plans:  
  – Similar to 401(k)s but for employees of public schools, tax-exempt organizations, and certain ministers.  
  – Contribution limits typically match 401(k) amounts.  

• 457 Plans:  
  – Offered by state/local governments and some nonprofits.  
  – Contribution limits may be coordinated with 401(k) or 403(b) plans in certain circumstances.  
  – Often do not carry the 10% early withdrawal penalty on distributions taken after separation from service, though ordinary income taxes apply.

#### 4) SIMPLE IRA
A SIMPLE IRA is often used by small businesses. Contribution limits are lower than standard 401(k)s but higher than Traditional and Roth IRAs. Employers must either match employee contributions or make non-elective contributions.

#### 5) SEP-IRA
A Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) is another small business retirement tool. Typically, only employers contribute to this plan (though employees who are self-employed function as their own employers). Contribution limits can be quite large, allowing up to 25% of compensation, subject to an annual cap.

#### Catch-Up Contributions in Employer Plans
Similar to IRAs, participants age 50 and older can make additional contributions, referred to as “catch-up contributions.” This feature permits individuals nearing retirement to accelerate their savings especially during peak earning years.

#### Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)
Most pre-tax retirement accounts (including Traditional IRAs and employer plans) require participants to begin taking minimum distributions at a set age (73 or 75 under certain updated rules). Failing to meet these RMDs results in significant tax penalties. Roth IRAs do not require RMDs during the original owner’s lifetime, enhancing their flexibility for retirement and estate planning.

#### Impact on Taxable Income
Traditional contributions reduce current AGI and taxable income. Roth contributions do not reduce current taxable income but can generate future tax-free growth. Selecting between Traditional and Roth often depends on expected future tax brackets, current cash flow needs, and eligibility based on income thresholds.

### Comparing HSAs, FSAs, and Retirement Accounts

Below is a simplified comparison table highlighting some features:

| Feature                      | HSA                      | FSA (Health/Dependent)         | Traditional IRA / 401(k)                | Roth IRA / Roth 401(k)                 |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Tax Treatment of Contributions | Pre-tax or deductible      | Pre-tax (salary reduction)       | Pre-tax (limits may vary by income)     | After-tax                              |
| Growth of Funds             | Tax-deferred, potentially tax-free when used for qualified expenses | Not applicable (used for current year expenses) | Tax-deferred                           | Tax-free (if qualified)               |
| Distribution Taxation       | Tax-free for qualified medical; otherwise ordinary income + penalty | N/A—used for ongoing expenses           | Ordinary income (subject to early withdrawal penalty if <59½)               | Tax-free on qualified distributions   |
| Annual Contribution Limits  | Higher than FSA; ~ $4k–$8k range depending on coverage | Lower (~$3k for Health; $5k for Dependent) | Higher (e.g., $22.5k for 401(k); $6k–$7k for IRA) | Similar or same as Traditional for 401(k); IRA is $6k–$7k range              |
| Carryover/Catch-Up          | $1k catch-up for ages 55+; funds carry forward indefinitely  | Limited carryover or use-it-or-lose-it  | $1k catch-up for IRAs (ages 50+); more for 401(k) | Same catch-up but taxed differently    |
| Potential Penalties         | 20% penalty for non-medical <65  | Forfeiture of unused funds        | 10% if withdrawn before 59½ (absent exception)    | 10% if withdrawn before 59½ (absent exception)   |

### Real-World Illustrations

#### Case Study 1: Maximizing Tax Savings with Combined Accounts
• Samantha, 48, who has a modest emergency fund but foresees regular medical costs, contributes to both her HSA and her employer’s 401(k).  
• Her annual salary is $80,000, and she decides to defer $10,000 into her 401(k) and contribute $3,850 into her HSA.  
• Net effect: Her W-2 Box 1 wages decrease by $13,850, reducing her taxable income. The funds in both plans grow tax-deferred. Samantha also reaps additional savings by using HSA dollars for out-of-pocket expenses, preserving after-tax income for other needs.

#### Case Study 2: FSA Underestimation vs. Overestimation
• Marcus elects a Health FSA for $2,000 but only uses $1,500 for the year, forfeiting $500 under the plan rules. He regrets not precisely estimating his medical costs, effectively losing the $500 difference.  
• On the other hand, Alicia, who carefully budgets $2,000 for her projected medical treatment, uses the entire $2,000 plus an extra $100 allowed by the plan’s grace period. She perfectly optimizes her FSA, saving on taxes and covering her entire out-of-pocket medical costs pre-tax.

#### Case Study 3: Choosing Between Traditional and Roth 401(k)
• Shawn, 30, anticipates being in a higher tax bracket later in life. He chooses Roth 401(k) contributions to pay taxes now at a presumably lower rate, expecting tax-free growth and withdrawals after retirement.  
• His coworker, Brenda, is 58 and nearing retirement, with a higher salary. She contributes to a Traditional 401(k) to maximize current-year tax savings, anticipating her income (and marginal tax bracket) will be significantly lower once she retires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Diagram: Flow of Contributions and Tax Savings

Below is a simplified diagram illustrating how contributions to various accounts reduce current-year taxable income and accumulate for future benefit:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Gross Income"] --> B["Elect Pre-Tax Salary Deferrals <br/> (401(k), FSA, HSA)"]
    B --> C["Remaining Taxable Wages"]
    C --> D["Pay Federal (and State) Income Tax on Reduced Amount"]
    D --> E["Contributions Grow Tax-Deferred or Tax-Free"]
```

In this flow, each pre-tax contribution you elect reduces the pool of income subject to immediate taxation (with some nuance for items like Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA contributions).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Best Practices and Pitfalls

• Track and Verify Eligibility: Confirm HDHP enrollment for HSA eligibility or properly structure your FSA to avoid losing funds.  
• Know Contribution Deadlines: Some accounts allow contributions up to the tax-filing deadline (e.g., Traditional and Roth IRAs). Employer plans typically require elections during open enrollment or specific times of year.  
• Avoid Early Withdrawals: Except for medical or qualified expenses, dipping into these accounts prematurely can trigger penalties and undermine long-term goals.  
• Capitalize on Employer Match: If available, contribute at least enough to capture the full match in an employer-sponsored plan—this is effectively a guaranteed return on your contribution.  
• Analyze Traditional vs. Roth: Depending on your age, expected future income, and tax rate, choosing a Traditional or Roth vehicle can substantially alter your long-term tax obligations.  
• Estimate Health/Dependent Care Costs Carefully: Especially for FSAs, be sure to budget conservatively to avoid forfeiting unused funds (unless your plan offers a carryover).  
• HSA Investment Options: Many HSA providers permit investing contributions in mutual funds or similar vehicles once a balance threshold is met. This can accelerate growth over time, but watch out for provider fees.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Putting It All Together

Tax-advantaged accounts are a cornerstone of individual tax and financial planning strategies. They offer opportunities to reduce current AGI, accumulate tax-sheltered or tax-free growth, and plan for healthcare and retirement needs in a well-structured manner:

• HSAs are unique in their triple tax advantage, provided you meet HDHP requirements.  
• FSAs help individuals cover medical or dependent care costs with pre-tax dollars but have strict annual use provisions.  
• Retirement plans (IRAs, 401(k)s, and other employer-sponsored options) represent powerful long-term savings vehicles, each with unique rules on contributions, income limits, tax treatment, and distribution requirements.

Careful planning ensures you select the best combination of accounts, considering both immediate and long-term tax implications.

## Quiz on HSAs, FSAs, and Retirement Accounts

{{< quizdown >}}

### Which of the following features best describes the main advantage of contributing to an HSA?

- [ ] Funds in the account do not grow tax-deferred
- [x] Contributions are tax-deductible and distributions for qualified medical expenses are tax-free
- [ ] It requires no specific health coverage to qualify
- [ ] Withdrawals for non-medical uses before age 65 are not subject to penalty

> **Explanation:** HSAs have a triple tax advantage: contributions are tax-deductible (or pre-tax through payroll), earnings grow tax-deferred, and distributions for qualified medical expenses are tax-free. Non-qualified withdrawals before age 65 generally incur a 20% penalty.

---

### Which statement accurately summarizes the “use it or lose it” rule for FSAs?

- [x] Unused FSA funds may be forfeited unless the plan permits a carryover or short grace period
- [ ] Unused funds in the FSA always roll over indefinitely
- [ ] All unused funds automatically convert to HSA contributions
- [ ] You can use an FSA even if you have no qualifying expenses

> **Explanation:** A key limitation of FSAs is that any unspent funds remaining at the plan year's end (or after a limited grace/carryover period) may be forfeited. This rule does not apply to HSAs.

---

### Which of the following retirement accounts typically allows for the highest pre-tax contribution limits?

- [ ] Roth IRA
- [x] 401(k) or similar employer-sponsored plan
- [ ] Traditional IRA
- [ ] Dependent Care FSA

> **Explanation:** While Traditional and Roth IRAs have lower annual limits (e.g., $6k–$7k for many taxpayers), 401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans often permit substantially higher annual contributions.

---

### An individual, age 50 or older, making catch-up contributions to a 401(k) is:

- [x] Allowed to exceed the standard annual maximum limit by an additional catch-up amount
- [ ] Forbidden from contributing more than the standard limit
- [ ] Required by law to cease employer matching
- [ ] Automatically disqualified from contributing to a Roth IRA

> **Explanation:** Tax law permits individuals aged 50 or older to contribute a “catch-up” amount in addition to the regular annual maximum to several types of retirement plans, including 401(k)s.

---

### HSA distributions for non-medical expenses after age 65 are generally:

- [x] Treated similarly to distributions from a Traditional IRA, taxed as ordinary income with no penalty
- [ ] Always tax-free, regardless of purpose
- [ ] Subject to an additional 20% penalty plus ordinary income tax
- [ ] Not allowed under any circumstance

> **Explanation:** Once an individual is 65 or older, non-medical distributions from HSAs are taxed like distributions from a Traditional IRA (ordinary income) but without the 20% penalty.

---

### Which best describes a key difference between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA?

- [x] Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars
- [ ] Roth IRAs require RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions) while Traditional IRAs do not
- [ ] Traditional IRAs cannot be converted to Roth IRAs
- [ ] Roth IRAs impose a 20% penalty on early withdrawals

> **Explanation:** Traditional IRAs often allow for tax-deductible contributions depending on income levels and coverage by workplace plans. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

---

### If a taxpayer enrolls in both a Health FSA and a Dependent Care FSA, which of the following is true?

- [ ] Contributions to each plan must be the same amount
- [x] Each plan has separate contribution limits and can be used only for the respective qualified expenses
- [ ] FSA funds can be combined and used interchangeably for health or dependent care
- [ ] The taxpayer cannot claim a child tax credit if enrolled in a Dependent Care FSA

> **Explanation:** Health FSAs and Dependent Care FSAs have distinct contribution limits, and their funds cannot be interchanged. Each one must be used exclusively for its respective qualifying expenses.

---

### One primary advantage of a cafeteria plan (which includes most employer-sponsored FSAs) is:

- [ ] All plan participants automatically qualify for Medicare
- [ ] It lowers the employee’s salary for retirement plan calculations
- [x] Contributions reduce both federal income tax and FICA tax
- [ ] Catch-up contributions are prohibited

> **Explanation:** Cafeteria plan contributions, such as those made to FSAs, are typically excluded from taxable wages for both federal income and FICA tax calculations—leading to more immediate tax savings for employees.

---

### A key benefit for individuals who open an HSA but do not use the funds immediately for medical expenses is:

- [x] They can allow the balance to grow, potentially investing it for future healthcare costs
- [ ] They lose any unused balance at year-end
- [ ] They are restricted from using the funds once they retire
- [ ] They must pay taxes annually on any investment earnings

> **Explanation:** HSA balances can roll over from year to year, and many custodians allow account holders to invest HSA contributions. This enables the funds to grow tax-free until used for qualified medical expenses.

---

### The tax treatment for Traditional 401(k) contributions is best explained as:

- [x] Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income; distributions are taxed as ordinary income
- [ ] Contributions are after-tax and withdrawals are tax-free
- [ ] Contributions are partially deductible
- [ ] All employer matching contributions are taxed immediately

> **Explanation:** Traditional 401(k) contributions are generally made on a pre-tax basis, which lowers current taxable income. At distribution, the amounts withdrawn (including earnings) are taxed as ordinary income.
