## 6.2 Valuation Techniques & Discounts (Minority, Marketability)

Valuating closely held business interests is a critical component of effective gift and estate tax planning. When transferring partial interests to family members or other related parties, taxpayers and their advisors often apply discounts to adjust the fair market value of those interests. These discounts—particularly the minority interest discount and the discount for lack of marketability—recognize that partial ownership stakes may be more difficult to sell and carry less control. Understanding how to substantiate and quantify these discounts is essential for Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) advising clients on transfers during life. In this section, we will delve into the theory and practice of these valuation techniques, typical discount ranges, relevant tax regulations, and real-world examples.

### Overview of Valuation Techniques for Gift Tax Purposes

Valuation is governed by the principle of “fair market value” (FMV), which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defines as the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller when neither is under compulsion to buy or sell, and both have reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. For publicly traded securities, FMV is straightforward to determine—one simply refers to the market price on a given date. However, determining FMV for interests in closely held businesses, family limited partnerships (FLPs), or limited liability companies (LLCs) can be far more intricate.

Common valuation approaches include:

• The Income Approach (e.g., Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method)  
• The Market Approach (comparing to publicly traded companies or completed transactions)  
• The Asset-Based Approach (applying net asset value or adjusting assets and liabilities to FMV)

Within these frameworks, professional appraisers or valuation experts factor in discounts—most notably, the minority interest discount (a reduction for lack of control) and the discount for lack of marketability (a reduction for inability to quickly divest).

The resulting valuations directly influence gift tax liability, estate tax calculations, and compliance requirements when filing Form 709 (Gift Tax Return). CPAs who understand the justifications, magnitudes, and documentation requirements for these discounts are better equipped to optimize their clients’ tax positions.

### Minority Interest Discount

A minority interest discount adjusts for the reduced share price attributable to a lack of controlling rights and influence. A minority stake owner generally lacks the power to:

• Appoint or remove management.  
• Declare or adjust dividend/distribution policies.  
• Directly influence business strategy or day-to-day operations.  
• Enter into or terminate major contracts.

When a buyer cannot effectively control the direction of a company or its distribution policies, that buyer is typically willing to pay less for the partial stake. Therefore, a discount is applied to the pro-rata portion of the entity’s value that the minority stake represents.  

#### Typical Minority Discount Ranges

Minority interest discounts can vary widely from 10% up to 40%, or even higher in situations where minority shareholders are substantially restricted (e.g., with extremely limited voting rights or stringent transfer restrictions). However, typical ranges outlined in professional valuation literature and court cases often hover between 15% and 25%.

The exact discount percentage depends on entity-specific factors, such as:  
• Voting vs. non-voting shares.  
• Existence of shareholder agreements restricting certain rights.  
• Historical dividend distributions.  
• Governance structure and bylaws.  
• Size of the ownership block relative to total outstanding shares.

#### Real-World Example of Minority Interest Valuation

Consider a family-owned enterprise (structured as an S Corporation) valued at \$10 million on a controlling basis. An heir is gifted 10% of the shares. If a 20% minority interest discount is justified, the FMV of the gifted shares would be:

• Pro-rata value without discount: \$10 million × 10% = \$1 million  
• Less: 20% minority interest discount → \$1 million × 20% = \$200,000  
• Adjusted minority value = \$1 million – \$200,000 = \$800,000

Hence, for gift tax purposes, that 10% stake would be valued at \$800,000 rather than \$1 million. Properly substantiating that discount can reduce the taxable amount of the gift, offering potential tax savings.

### Discount for Lack of Marketability (DLOM)

A discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) accounts for the reduced liquidity in an ownership stake that lacks an active trading market. Even if the interest is not severely restricted in terms of governance, an investor typically expects a discount if it is difficult or time-consuming to convert the interest into cash.

#### Drivers of Marketability Discounts

• Absence of a readily available market or exchange.  
• Transfer restrictions (e.g., right of first refusal clauses, buy-sell agreements).  
• Time and costs associated with finding a willing buyer.  
• Limited liquidity and unpredictability of distributions.  
• Illiquidity further complicated by management structure or business type (e.g., a specialized real estate partnership).

#### Typical Marketability Discount Ranges

Marketability discounts for privately held companies often fall between 15% and 40%, depending on the level of restrictions, projected holding period, and the volatility of anticipated earnings or distributions. Over the years, the IRS and Tax Court have reviewed multiple studies (e.g., restricted stock studies, pre-IPO studies) to gauge an appropriate discount window. The determination of a specific discount range always relies on the unique facts and circumstances of each valuation.

#### The Intersection of Minority Interest and Lack of Marketability

It is not uncommon for a valuation expert to apply both a minority interest discount and a discount for lack of marketability. In many gift tax or estate tax scenarios, CPAs must be aware that these discounts could compound. For example, assume a 15% minority discount is determined first, followed by a 20% DLOM on the result. The combined discount is not 35% of the original pro-rata value (simply adding 15% + 20%), but rather 15% of the original plus 20% of the already-discounted amount. This results in a slightly lower effective discount calculation but can still be substantial.

Using the previous example of an entity valued at \$10 million on a controlling basis, if the gift is 10% (i.e., \$1 million pro rata before any discounts), and the valuation supports a 15% minority discount and a subsequent 20% lack-of-marketability discount, the math would be:

• Minority Discount (15%): \$1,000,000 × 15% = \$150,000  
• Value after Minority Discount: \$1,000,000 – \$150,000 = \$850,000  
• Lack of Marketability Discount (20% of \$850,000): \$170,000  
• Combined Adjusted Value: \$850,000 – \$170,000 = \$680,000  

The effective overall discount is \$320,000 off the original \$1 million, or 32%, rather than a straight 35%.

### Methodologies for Quantifying Discounts

Valuation professionals use a variety of empirical and theoretical models to substantiate discount rates. While CPAs are typically not required to be credentialed appraisers, understanding the basics of these approaches helps them review and interpret appraisals.

1. **Restricted Stock Studies**  
   Researchers compare the prices of restricted shares of publicly traded companies to their unrestricted, marketable counterparts. The difference in trading prices is used as an empirical basis to approximate the discount.

2. **Pre-IPO Studies**  
   By analyzing private placements before an initial public offering (IPO), these studies try to deduce discounts needed to compensate for illiquidity prior to listing. The difference between final IPO pricing and the price paid by private investors is one measurement of a lack-of-marketability discount.

3. **Option-Pricing Models**  
   Some Analysts employ financial models (e.g., Black-Scholes or binomial methods) to approximate the cost of put options that would “guarantee” liquidity. The cost of such derivatives can act as a proxy for DLOM.

4. **Qualitative Factors & Scorecards**  
   Where direct empirical evidence is insufficient, appraisers may use a scorecard approach to evaluate relevant factors (like business size, management, financial health, or restrictions) and then assign a discount range based on a reasoned weighting of each factor.

### Practical Case Study: Family Limited Partnership

Imagine a family limited partnership (FLP) set up to hold commercial real estate. The FLP is owned 2% by the parents as general partners (with full control) and 98% by limited partner interests spread among children. The parents decide to gift a 10% limited partnership interest to one child to gradually transition ownership.

1. **Entity Value**: The FLP’s real estate assets have an appraised FMV of \$5 million, and the FLP also has \$500,000 in liabilities, resulting in \$4.5 million in net equity.  
2. **Pro-Rata Value of the Gift**: 10% of \$4.5 million is \$450,000, prior to discounts.  
3. **Minority Interest Discount**: The child will hold a non-controlling interest. The appraiser estimates a 15% discount for lack of control (approximately \$67,500). This reduces the gift’s value to \$382,500.  
4. **Marketability Discount**: The limited partnership units cannot be freely transferred without consent, and there is no liquid market for such a specialized partnership. The appraiser estimates an additional 25% discount on \$382,500 (i.e., \$95,625), reducing the value to approximately \$286,875.  
5. **Documentation & Compliance**: A qualified appraisal is used to support these figures. When preparing Form 709, the parents’ gift is substantiated with the appraisal, significantly lowering the property’s reported tax value while staying within IRS guidelines.

### Visualizing the Valuation Process

Below is a basic flowchart illustrating how valuation discounts apply to a partnership interest. This mermaid diagram tracks the journey from the initial pro-rata value to the final discounted figure.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A(Determine Partnership's Total FMV) --> B(Calculate Pro-Rata Value of Gift)
    B --> C(Apply Minority Interest Discount)
    C --> D(Apply Lack of Marketability Discount)
    D --> E(Final Adjusted Value)
```

Explanation:  
• Start with the total fair market value (FMV) of the entity.  
• Calculate the pro-rata share of the gifted interest in that total.  
• Apply the minority interest discount if the gifted stake lacks control.  
• Apply the marketability discount for illiquidity.  
• Arrive at the final adjusted value used for gift tax reporting.

---

### Documentation and Substantiation

For federal gift tax return purposes, taxpayers must document the basis and magnitude of any valuation discounts rigorously. In practice, this includes:  
• Engaging a qualified appraiser with expertise in valuing entities similar to the one at hand.  
• Keeping detailed records of the valuation approaches, assumptions, and data.  
• Referencing relevant Tax Court cases or empirical studies that support the discount ranges used.  
• Maintaining a robust paper trail in case the IRS challenges the discounts in an audit or dispute.

---

### Potential Pitfalls and Common Challenges

1. **Overly Aggressive Discounts**  
   Applying unrealistic or unsupported discount rates can lead to IRS scrutiny. If the IRS challenges the valuation, penalties and interest may accrue.

2. **Improper Sequencing**  
   Confusion often arises over how to sequentially apply the minority and marketability discounts. The minority discount is typically applied first, followed by the lack-of-marketability discount on the reduced value.

3. **Ignoring Operational Realities**  
   Discounts should be reflective of real-world constraints. If a partnership agreement effectively grants certain rights to limited partners, the appropriate minority discount might be smaller.

4. **Failure to Update Appraisals**  
   Over time, changing market conditions, updated financial statements, or modifications to partnership agreements can alter discount rates. CPAs should ensure appraisals remain current for each distinct period.

### Best Practices for CPAs and Planners

• Encourage clients to engage qualified valuation professionals early in the gift planning process.  
• Maintain transparency and comprehensive documentation—sound appraisals withstand greater IRS scrutiny.  
• Watch for legislative or regulatory changes regarding valuation discounts, particularly for family-owned entities.  
• Communicate to clients that discount strategies must be aligned with their overall goals for ownership, control, and succession.

## Master Your Knowledge: Minority and Marketability Discounts

{{< quizdown >}}

### A key reason for applying a minority interest discount is:
- [ ] Lack of liquidity.
- [x] Lack of control.
- [ ] Tax penalties.
- [ ] Real property devaluation.

> **Explanation:** A minority interest discount primarily reflects the reduced control and inability to influence business decisions that a minority interest holder faces.

### Which discount is generally applied first in a valuation scenario?
- [ ] Marketability discount first.
- [x] Minority interest discount first.
- [ ] Whichever is larger is applied first.
- [ ] They must always be applied simultaneously.

> **Explanation:** The minority interest discount is typically applied first; the marketability discount is then applied to the already reduced value.

### When both minority and marketability discounts are applied sequentially, the total combined discount:
- [ ] Is zero because the discounts cancel each other out.
- [ ] Is the simple sum of the two discount percentages.
- [x] Is multiplicative, resulting in a slightly smaller effective rate than a direct sum.
- [ ] Must always exceed 50%.

> **Explanation:** The second discount is applied to the value that already reflects the first discount, making the total discount multiplicative rather than a simple sum.

### Which of the following factors commonly influences the magnitude of a marketability discount?
- [x] Transfer restrictions in the governing documents.
- [ ] Depreciation recapture rules.
- [ ] Cost-of-goods-sold percentages.
- [ ] Shareholder compensation strategies.

> **Explanation:** Marketability discounts often depend on contractual limitations embedded in partnership or shareholder agreements that limit or complicate transfers.

### An FLP is valued at $2 million. A 10% limited interest is gifted with a 20% minority discount and a 25% lack of marketability discount. Which figure best approximates the final value after both discounts? (Round to nearest thousand)
- [x] $120,000
- [ ] $135,000
- [ ] $150,000
- [ ] $100,000

> **Explanation:** Pro-rata value is $200,000 (10% of $2 million). Subtract the 20% minority discount = $160,000. Then subtract the 25% marketability discount (25% of $160,000 = $40,000) = $120,000 final value.

### A restricted stock study is often used to help quantify which discount?
- [ ] Minority interest.
- [x] Lack of marketability.
- [ ] Net operating loss discount.
- [ ] Alternative valuation discount.

> **Explanation:** Restricted stock studies compare the prices of restricted shares (private or limited resale) with their freely traded counterparts, helping appraisers approximate the lack of marketability discount.

### Which of the following can reduce the size of a minority interest discount?
- [x] The existence of special rights or veto power given to minority shareholders.
- [ ] Higher expected future taxes on capital gains.
- [ ] The business having multiple lines of operation.
- [ ] An individual’s personal guarantee on a business loan.

> **Explanation:** If a minority stake holder has special rights that effectively grant them greater influence, the degree of minority discount decreases because their position is stronger.

### A “scorecard approach” in valuation generally involves:
- [ ] Relying solely on market comparables without adjustment.
- [ ] Using only the discounted cash flow method.
- [x] Evaluating a list of qualitative and quantitative factors to estimate a discount.
- [ ] Applying IRS-provided percentages with no variation.

> **Explanation:** The scorecard approach weighs various objective and subjective factors—like management, market outlook, and control rights—to arrive at an informed discount estimate.

### Why is professional appraisal often recommended for applying valuation discounts?
- [ ] The Section 179 expense deduction requires them.
- [ ] To circumvent state nexus rules.
- [ ] Valuation discounts are only valid if self-reported.
- [x] To ensure credible, defensible valuations that meet IRS standards.

> **Explanation:** Engaging a professional appraiser helps satisfy IRS requirements for substantiated, well-documented valuations that can withstand audit scrutiny.

### A discount for lack of marketability arises primarily because:
- [x] Investors cannot easily convert their ownership interests into cash.
- [ ] The entity is subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
- [ ] Minority owners can veto major business decisions.
- [ ] Management’s salaries are too high.

> **Explanation:** Illiquidity and inability to easily sell an ownership stake is the core rationale behind the lack-of-marketability discount.
