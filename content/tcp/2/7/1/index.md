## 7.1 Retirement Vehicles & Tax-Deferred Growth (401(k), 403(b), 457 Plans)

Retirement planning is a cornerstone of individual financial security. As a CPA candidate preparing for the Tax Compliance and Planning (TCP) exam, you will encounter questions on employer-provided and individually managed retirement plans. This section focuses on stand-out tax-advantaged, employer-sponsored vehicles in the United States: the 401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans. A thorough understanding of statutory contribution limits, plan features, catch-up provisions, and key differences among these plans is crucial not only for exam preparedness but also for providing valuable advisory services to clients.

### Introduction to Tax-Deferred Retirement Plans

Retirement plans allow individuals to defer a portion of their compensation into tax-advantaged accounts. The money grows tax-deferred, meaning contributions—along with any investment gains—remain untaxed until withdrawn (or remain tax-exempt in the case of Roth contributions if certain conditions are met). By deferring taxes, participants may lower current taxable income, potentially reducing current-year tax liability.

From an accounting and tax standpoint, these programs represent an intersection of deferred compensation, payroll management, and strategic tax planning. Understanding how to navigate contribution limits, plan rules, and employer matching formulas is central to your role as a trusted CPA.

### Key Tax Considerations

• Deductibility: Employee contributions to traditional 401(k), 403(b), and most 457 plans reduce current year taxable income, subject to statutory limits.  
• Tax Liability Upon Distribution: Withdrawals from traditional deferrals are generally subject to ordinary income tax. Early withdrawals (before age 59½, unless an exception applies) may incur a 10% additional tax.  
• Roth Option: Some plans offer a Roth feature. Contributions do not reduce current taxable income, but qualified distributable amounts (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.  
• Catch-Up Provisions: Lawmakers recognize individuals over 50 may need to save more aggressively. Additional “catch-up” contributions are allowed for older workers, and some plan rules have unique service-based catch-ups.  
• Special Limitations: Certain 457 plans, especially governmental vs. non-governmental, allow distinct catch-up strategies in the final three years before retirement.

### 401(k) Plan Features

The 401(k) plan is typically sponsored by private-sector employers (including corporations and partnerships), making it one of the most common retirement vehicles in the U.S. 

#### Eligibility and Participation
401(k) eligibility varies by employer. Some require a minimum waiting period (e.g., one year of service) or specific age criteria. Certain safe harbor 401(k) plans allow immediate vesting in employer contributions to satisfy nondiscrimination testing requirements.

#### Elective Deferral Limits
• For the 2023 tax year, the basic employee deferral limit is typically $22,500. This limit is subject to cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) in subsequent years.  
• Individuals aged 50 and above may generally contribute an additional $7,500 in catch-up contributions, bringing their total possible deferral to $30,000 for 2023.  
• Employer contributions (matching and non-elective) plus employee elective deferrals have an overall annual addition limit—often referred to by the IRS as the Code §415(c) limit (e.g., $66,000 in 2023, not including catch-up amounts).

#### Employer Contributions and Matching
Employers are not required to match employee contributions, but many do to encourage participation. Common matching formulas might be:  
• 100% match on the first 3% of salary deferred, plus 50% match on the next 2%.  
• A safe harbor match, such as 100% of the first 4% of pay deferred.  
Employer contributions generally complement participant deferrals, promoting higher total contributions and tax deferral.

#### Vesting
Vesting schedules ensure participants earn the right to employer contributions over time. Two common vesting schedules are:  
• Cliff vesting: 100% vesting after a fixed period (e.g., three years).  
• Graded vesting: 20% per year over five years, or similar increments.  

#### Roth 401(k) Option
Many employers offer a Roth 401(k) option. Although contributions are made with after-tax dollars, qualified distributions (after age 59½ and five tax years in the plan) are entirely tax-free, including any investment earnings.

### 403(b) Plan Features

A 403(b) plan (also called a tax-sheltered annuity or TSA) is a retirement vehicle for employees of public schools, certain tax-exempt organizations (like charities), and other nonprofit entities. Despite similarities to 401(k) plans, 403(b)s have distinct nuances.

#### Eligibility and Sponsorship
Universities, hospitals, churches, and public-school systems primarily sponsor 403(b) plans. Participation often allows for immediate enrollment, but each employer has discretion over eligibility criteria.

#### Contribution Limits
• The same annual deferral limit as a 401(k) generally applies: $22,500 plus a $7,500 catch-up for those aged 50 or older (2023 amounts).  
• In addition to the standard over-50 catch-up, some 403(b) participants with at least 15 years of service with a qualifying employer may contribute an extra $3,000 per year for up to five years (subject to a lifetime cap of $15,000). This special service-based catch-up is unique to 403(b).

#### Investment Options
While 401(k) plans offer a broad range of mutual funds, 403(b) plans historically focused on annuity contracts. Many modern 403(b)s allow investment in mutual funds as well. Annuities remain an option for those seeking guaranteed lifetime income streams.

#### Vesting in 403(b)
Similar to 401(k) plans, 403(b) employer contributions might have vesting schedules. However, nonprofit organizations often use simpler vesting rules or immediate vesting to attract and retain talent.

### 457 Plan Features

A 457 plan is offered primarily by governmental employers (states, municipalities) and certain tax-exempt entities. While its core function is similar—allowing employees to defer income—there are unique distinctions worth noting.

#### Governmental vs. Non-Governmental 457
• Governmental 457(b) plans: Generally available to state and local government employees. These plans may allow for additional distribution flexibility, such as penalty-free earlier concept of an “unforeseeable emergency.” A Roth 457 option may be available.  
• Tax-exempt 457(b) plans for non-governmental employers: Typically available to employees of private tax-exempt organizations. They have more restrictive distribution rules and are subject to the claims of the employer’s general creditors, creating potential risk for participants should the organization become insolvent.

#### Contribution Limits
• For 2023, participants may defer up to $22,500. The age 50+ catch-up is $7,500—same as for 401(k) and 403(b).  
• Alternatively, a “special 457 catch-up” may apply in the three years preceding an employee’s normal retirement age. This special 457 catch-up can be as high as double the normal limit (e.g., $45,000 total), depending on prior underutilized contribution capacity.

#### Early Withdrawals
One of the advantages of governmental 457(b) plans is the absence of the 10% early distribution penalty for withdrawals prior to age 59½ (though distributions will still be taxed as ordinary income). However, distributions taken while still employed or not meeting other plan qualifications can face additional restrictions.

### Comparing 401(k), 403(b), and 457 Plans

Below is a high-level flowchart demonstrating the flow of contributions within these retirement vehicles. All three allow for significant tax-deferred accumulation, but differ in their sponsors, eligibility criteria, and special catch-up features.

```mermaid

    C --> E
    D --> E
    E --> F((Retirement))
```

Diagram Explanation:  
• Employees contribute part of their salary to the different employer-sponsored plans.  
• The contributions then enjoy tax-deferred (or tax-free, if Roth) growth over time.  
• Ultimately, the funds are distributed at or after retirement, typically becoming subject to taxation if pre-tax contributions were made (or potentially tax-free for Roth accounts).

### Contribution Limits and Catch-Up Provisions

While the annual employee deferral limit commonly remains unified across these plans, each has unique nuances regarding catch-up contributions:

• Age 50+ Catch-Up:  
  – 401(k): $7,500 above the standard limit.  
  – 403(b): $7,500 above the standard limit (plus potential additional 15-year “service” catch-up).  
  – 457(b): $7,500 above the standard limit, or in certain circumstances, the special 457 catch-up (whichever is larger).  

• Unique 403(b) Catch-Up for Long-Term Employees: Up to $3,000 for each 15th year of service with the same employer, up to a lifetime max of $15,000.  

• Special 457 Catch-Up: During the final three years before the normal retirement date set by the plan, participants may be able to contribute up to twice the annual limit (provided prior deferrals were lower than permissible in earlier years).

Acknowledging how each catch-up provision applies is crucial for exam scenarios and for advising real clients who might qualify for multiple or layered catch-up strategies.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Example 1: Maximizing 401(k) Contributions
Chris, age 52, works at a tech company that sponsors a safe harbor 401(k). In 2023, Chris can contribute $22,500 plus a $7,500 catch-up (total $30,000 in elective deferrals). The employer matches 100% on the first 3% of pay and 50% on the next 2%. Chris, earning $100,000 annually, defers at least 5% ($5,000), resulting in an employer match of $4,000. Chris’s total annual contribution is $34,000 between employee and employer money, well below the overall $66,000 limit for participants under IRA/IRS rules (the $7,500 catch-up does not count against that limit). This approach significantly reduces Chris’s taxable income and boosts long-term retirement savings.

#### Example 2: Special 457 Catch-Up
Dana, age 60, works for a state agency offering a governmental 457 plan and has only contributed an average of $10,000 per year over the past decade, well below the maximum allowable. With retirement approaching, Dana can use the special 457 catch-up in her final three years and potentially contribute up to $45,000 in a single year. Such an aggressive savings strategy can help her rapidly ‘catch up’ on retirement funding while deferring income taxes.  

#### Example 3: 403(b) 15-Year Service Catch-Up
Paula, 55, has spent 16 years at a public university. She has never utilized the special 403(b) service-based catch-up. She is eligible to add up to $3,000 per year for a total of five years or $15,000 beyond the normal statutory and age-based catch-up limits. Assuming Paula meets all eligibility criteria (including consistent service with the same employer), she could significantly boost her retirement savings in her final working years by leveraging multiple catch-up avenues.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

• Coordinate Plan Contributions: In some cases, employees access multiple plans (e.g., 401(k) at a main job and a 457 plan through part-time government employment). Plan participants must be aware how contributions aggregate or remain separate.  
• Monitor Vesting Schedules: Early job-hopping might jeopardize employer matching and profit-sharing if the participant is not fully vested. Make sure participants understand the vesting clock.  
• Understand Early Withdrawal Penalties: Traditional 401(k) and 403(b) distributions prior to age 59½ generally trigger a 10% penalty (unless an exception applies). Meanwhile, governmental 457 plans allow penalty-free pre-59½ distributions, but come with different distribution restrictions.  
• Avoid Over-Recontribution: Exceeding the annual deferral limit prompts corrective distributions. This is especially risky when individuals are employed by multiple employers simultaneously and contribute to multiple plans.  
• Educate on Roth vs. Traditional: Participants should evaluate whether they benefit more from a current deduction (traditional) or long-term tax-free growth (Roth).  

### Additional Considerations for CPA Candidates

• Interaction with Other Fringe Benefits: As discussed in earlier chapters (see Chapter 3 for advanced inclusions and exclusions), total compensation planning often involves evaluating group health benefits, cafeteria plans, and flexible spending accounts. Understanding how 401(k), 403(b), and 457 contributions reduce current-year wages for certain calculations can be critical in the exam.  
• Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs): Starting dates, amounts, and penalty for not taking a timely RMD (50% penalty on undistributed required amounts) are essential details. RMD rules were recently updated based on legislation such as the SECURE Act.  
• Integrating with IRAs: Some clients invest in IRAs alongside employer-sponsored plans. Knowing the IRA deduction phaseouts (see Chapter 3 for references to phaseouts) can help you advise on broader retirement strategies.

- [ ] 401(k)  
- [ ] 403(b)  
- [x] 457(b)  
- [ ] Traditional IRA  

> **Explanation:** The 457(b) plan has a special catch-up provision in the final three years before a participant’s retirement age. This can allow them to defer up to double the standard deferral limit, depending on prior underutilized contributions.

### A key benefit of the Roth feature in 401(k) or 403(b) plans is that:
- [x] Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified distributions are tax-free.  
- [ ] Contributions are tax-deductible.  
- [ ] There are no contribution limits.  
- [ ] RMDs are never required.  

> **Explanation:** Roth contributions are made after-tax, and if certain conditions (age 59½ and a 5-year rule) are satisfied, all distributions, including earnings, can be tax-free. However, minimum distribution rules do apply to Roth 401(k) and 403(b) plans after a certain age.

### Which of the following statements is false about 403(b) plans?
- [ ] They may allow employees to invest in annuity contracts.  
- [x] They are only available for faith-based organizations.  
- [ ] They can have the same elective deferral limits as 401(k) plans.  
- [ ] They allow an additional catch-up for employees with 15 years of service at the same employer.  

> **Explanation:** 403(b) plans apply to a range of non-profit settings (schools, hospitals, charities, etc.), not limited only to faith-based organizations.

### An individual who withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) at age 58 without meeting any qualifying exemptions will:
- [x] Incur a 10% early withdrawal penalty and taxes on the distribution.  
- [ ] Receive the entire amount free of taxes.  
- [ ] Only have to pay capital gains tax.  
- [ ] Avoid the 10% penalty because they are over age 55.  

> **Explanation:** Traditional 401(k) withdrawals prior to age 59½ typically incur a 10% penalty unless an exception applies. All amounts withdrawn are taxed at ordinary income rates, not capital gains rates.
