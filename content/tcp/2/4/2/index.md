## 4.2 Itemized Deductions: SALT Caps, Medical Expenses, Charitable Strategies

Itemized deductions are a key aspect of tax planning for individuals, providing an opportunity to reduce taxable income by subtracting specific allowable expenses. The decision to itemize rather than take the standard deduction depends on the taxpayer’s circumstances, the nature of their deductible expenses, and current tax law trends such as state and local tax (SALT) caps introduced under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This section explores the critical components of itemized deductions—SALT, medical expenses, charitable giving—and highlights advanced strategies for charitable contributions, like donor-advised funds.

Throughout this chapter, we will compare itemized deductions to the standard deduction, examine notable best practices to optimize itemized deductions, outline common pitfalls, and delve into sophisticated planning techniques that CPA exam candidates should master.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Overview of Itemized vs. Standard Deductions

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides two main pathways for reducing taxable income at the individual level:
• Taking the standard deduction.  
• Itemizing specific deductible expenses.

Many taxpayers default to the standard deduction, which offers simplicity and a relatively high, inflation-adjusted baseline deduction each year. Others benefit from itemizing if their qualified deductible expenses exceed the standard deduction threshold. With the significant increase in the standard deduction after the TCJA, fewer taxpayers now find itemizing beneficial, but high earners and individuals in high-tax or high-cost areas often still benefit from itemizing.

Below is a simplified table comparing the two approaches:

| Aspect                          | Standard Deduction                | Itemized Deductions                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Ease of Filing                  | Very straightforward              | Requires documentation and recordkeeping |
| Deduction Amount                | Set by statute; adjusted annually | Sum of qualifying deductible expenses  |
| Usage Rate                      | Majority of taxpayers             | Typically used by higher earners or those with significant deductible expenses |
| Complexity & Audit Risk         | Lower                             | Potentially higher, must substantiate with receipts or other records |

Exam Tip: Be aware of how thresholds for itemized deductions change periodically and how this can affect client decisions. The Uniform CPA Examination requires familiarity with both calculations to recommend tax strategies accurately.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### SALT Cap: State and Local Tax Deduction Limitation

One of the most significant changes introduced by the TCJA was the cap on state and local tax deductions—often called the SALT cap. Under current federal law, individuals can deduct a maximum of US$10,000 (US$5,000 for married filing separately) of combined state and local taxes, which includes:
• State and local income taxes or sales taxes (whichever is claimed).  
• Real estate (property) taxes.  
• Personal property taxes (e.g., vehicle registration fees based on value).  

For individuals in high-tax states, the SALT cap can drastically reduce their itemized deduction total. Some states have implemented SALT “workarounds” permitting individuals or pass-through entities to make direct state-level payments for a potential federal deduction, but from an exam perspective, focus on federal limitations:
• The SALT cap is a universal maximum for single and married taxpayers (except the lower cap for married taxpayers filing separately).  
• Assessing whether itemizing is beneficial often hinges on other large deductible expenses—particularly mortgage interest, charitable contributions, or significant medical expenses—that, in combination, exceed the standard deduction.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Medical Expense Deductions: Threshold Notes

Medical expenses are another major category of potential itemized deductions. However, the IRS sets floors that limit the net deduction available. As of current law, taxpayers may deduct qualifying unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of their Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). 

Qualifying medical expenses can include (but are not limited to): 
• Doctor and dentist fees.  
• Prescription eyeglasses, hearing aids, and related medical equipment.  
• Health insurance premiums (if not provided pre-tax through an employer).  
• Long-term care services, subject to certain limits.  
• Mileage driven for medical appointments (deductible at a standard medical mileage rate).

Exam Tip: The medical expense deduction threshold is highly tested. Remember that only the amount above 7.5% of AGI is allowable. CPA candidates should be meticulous in calculating AGI first, and then applying the threshold for medical deductions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Charitable Contributions: General Rules

Charitable contributions are one of the most flexible and commonly encountered itemized deductions. Taxpayers may donate cash or property to qualified 501(c)(3) organizations and deduct some or all of that donation, subject to certain AGI-based limitations. Key points include:
• Cash donations are generally deductible up to 60% of AGI.  
• Property donations (especially appreciated assets) may be subject to 50%, 30%, or 20% limitations depending on the type of property and the type of organization receiving the gift.  
• For non-cash contributions exceeding US$500, taxpayers must complete Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions, and maintain proper documentation.  

Moreover, any unused charitable deductions typically carry over up to five subsequent tax years. These carryforwards can be valuable for individuals whose annual giving surpasses the allowable AGI limits.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Advanced Charitable Giving Strategies

Beyond straightforward cash or property donations, taxpayers and advisors increasingly utilize advanced charitable giving vehicles and techniques to optimize both philanthropic impact and tax efficiency.

#### Donor-Advised Funds
A donor-advised fund (DAF) is a charitable account established at a public charity. The taxpayer contributes cash, securities, or other assets to the account and generally receives an immediate tax deduction in the year of contribution, subject to usual AGI limitations. However, the donor can recommend grants to specific charities over time. 

Key attributes of donor-advised funds:
• Flexibility: Funds can stay in the DAF for multiple years, while donors select qualified charities to support.  
• Immediate Deduction: The taxpayer may claim a deduction in the year of the DAF contribution, simplifying the strategy of “bunching” contributions to exceed the standard deduction threshold in a particular tax year.  
• Investment Growth: Assets in a DAF can be invested, allowing for potential tax-free growth before eventual distribution to charities.

#### Bunching Contributions
With the higher standard deduction amounts, some taxpayers only itemize in certain years. A typical approach is to “bunch” multiple years’ worth of charitable donations into one tax year so that total itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction threshold in that year. The next year, the taxpayer can revert to the standard deduction if itemized expenses do not reach the required level.

#### Charitable Remainder Trusts
While not always tested extensively in the context of moderate exam questions, Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs) enable donors to create a trust that pays income to designated non-charitable beneficiaries (often themselves) for a specified period, with the remainder interest distributed to a qualified charity. Donors may receive a current charitable deduction for the present value of the remainder interest, although limitations and actuarial calculations apply.

#### Appreciated Property Donations
Contributing appreciated stock or other appreciated assets directly to a qualified charity can yield a dual tax benefit:
1. The donor can claim a deduction for the fair market value (FMV) of the asset (subject to applicable AGI limits).  
2. The donor avoids capital gains tax on the appreciation embedded in the donated asset.  

These strategies can be especially valuable for taxpayers with a concentrated equity position who are also charitably inclined. The combination of a charitable deduction and bypassing capital gains often provides greater net tax savings than making a direct cash donation after liquidating the asset.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Comparing Itemized vs. Standard Deduction Outcomes

```

1. Estimate your potential itemized deductions: SALT (up to the cap), mortgage interest, medical expenses in excess of threshold, charitable giving, etc.  
2. Compare this total to your standard deduction.  
3. Opt for whichever is higher to maximize overall deductions.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Example Illustrations

#### Example 1: SALT Cap Impact  
• Lisa is single with US$160,000 AGI and pays US$12,000 in combined state income tax and property tax.  
• Due to the SALT cap, Lisa can only deduct US$10,000 of her state and local taxes.  
• She has mortgage interest of US$5,000 and charitable contributions of US$3,000.  
• Lisa’s total itemized deductions are US$10,000 (SALT, limited) + $5,000 (mortgage interest) + $3,000 (charity) = $18,000.  
• If her standard deduction were US$13,850, Lisa would itemize because $18,000 > $13,850, reducing her taxable income more significantly.

#### Example 2: Advanced Charitable Strategy  
• Ron and Carol are joint filers who typically donate around US$10,000 per year to various charities.  
• Their SALT taxes total US$9,000, and mortgage interest is US$3,000 per year. Their total itemized expenses (excluding charity) are $12,000, which is below their standard deduction (assume around US$27,700).  
• By contributing US$20,000 to a donor-advised fund in Year 1 instead of US$10,000 each year, they can claim $12,000 in other itemized deductions + $20,000 charitable = $32,000 total, well above their standard deduction.  
• In Year 2, when their itemized deductions may drop below the standard deduction, they can revert to the standard deduction. They still ultimately donate $10,000 each year to charity—the difference is purely timing for tax optimization.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Common Pitfalls in Itemized Deductions

1. **Incorrectly Calculating SALT:** Some individuals fail to consider that both real estate and state income taxes count toward the same SALT cap.  
2. **Overlooking AGI Thresholds for Medical:** If the taxpayer incorrectly calculates AGI or misapplies the medical threshold, they risk an inaccurate deduction.  
3. **Lack of Recordkeeping for Charitable Contributions:** Non-cash and large donations require extra documentation. Failing to supply appraisals for valuable property can lead to disallowed deductions.  
4. **Bunching Strategies Gone Wrong:** Timing must be methodical. If you cannot project your potential deductions accurately, bunching might provide less benefit than expected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Best Practices for Mastering Itemized Deductions

• **Maintain Organized Records:** Comprehensive documentation ensures you can quickly substantiate itemized amounts if audited.  
• **Project & Plan:** Utilize pro forma tax calculations to forecast whether itemizing or taking the standard deduction is more advantageous in any given year.  
• **Leverage Professional Tools:** Tax preparation software often has modules that automate standard vs. itemized comparisons.  
• **Stay Informed on Legislative Changes:** Expiring provisions or changes to deduction limits can significantly alter the standard vs. itemized deduction landscape.  
• **Consider Combining Strategies:** Pairing itemized deductions such as large charitable donations and known medical procedures in the same tax year can exceed the standard deduction threshold.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### CPA Exam Angle

The CPA exam frequently tests your ability to identify what expenses qualify for itemized deductions, compute allowable amounts (e.g., applying percentage thresholds, SALT caps), and compare itemized vs. standard deduction results. In addition:
• You may see scenario-based questions requiring you to determine whether the taxpayer should itemize.  
• Expect calculations involving partial, phased-out, or restricted deductions, especially around medical expenses and complex charitable rules.  
• Be sure to memorize the key AGI limitations (7.5% for medical, 60% for cash charitable contributions, etc.) and the SALT cap.

- [ ] The donor is required to pay capital gains tax before donating the stock.  
- [ ] The stock’s basis is limited to face value.  
- [ ] The appreciation is taxed at a higher ordinary rate.  

> **Explanation:** By donating appreciated stock directly, the donor can claim a deduction for the stock’s fair market value while bypassing capital gains tax on the appreciation.

### What is a primary benefit of using a donor-advised fund (DAF)?  
- [ ] Deducting 100% of charitable contributions without regard to AGI.  
- [x] Claiming an immediate deduction in the year of contribution while distributing funds to charities over multiple years.  
- [ ] Circumventing any need for official appraisals for noncash donations.  
- [ ] Eliminating the need to track carryforwards of charitable contributions.  

> **Explanation:** A donor-advised fund allows the donor to claim a full tax deduction in the year of contribution while granting the assets to various charities on a flexible timeline.

### In deciding between itemizing deductions or taking the standard deduction, which factor most frequently tips the scales toward itemizing?  
- [x] Total allowable itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction.  
- [ ] The taxpayer’s filing status is single.  
- [x] The taxpayer resides in a high-tax state and has significant SALT, mortgage interest, or charitable contributions.  
- [ ] The taxpayer’s AGI is less than $50,000.  

> **Explanation:** Taxpayers typically itemize when their allowed deductions exceed the standard deduction. In high-tax states or when large mortgage interest or charitable donations come into play, the sum can surpass the standard deduction.

### Which of the following must be mindful of the 60% of AGI limitation?  
- [x] Cash donations to public charities.  
- [ ] Cash donations to private operating foundations.  
- [ ] Appreciated property donated to a private nonoperating foundation.

- [x] $7,500  
- [ ] $15,000  
- [ ] $5,000  
- [x] $7,500 is correct because only the amount above 7.5% of AGI is deductible, which is $7,500  
- [ ] $9,000  

> **Explanation:** For 7.5% threshold: 7.5% of $100,000 = $7,500. The deductible portion is $15,000 - $7,500 = $7,500.

### Which of the following checklist items helps ensure a taxpayer can substantiate charitable deductions?  
- [ ] Rely solely on bank statements for all cash donations over $500.  
- [ ] Donate only to unregistered charities or private individuals.

> **Explanation:** The IRS requires contemporaneous written acknowledgments for single or cumulative donations of $250 or more and additional documentation for larger noncash contributions.

### Which statement is most accurate regarding the bunching strategy for charitable contributions?  
- [x] Taxpayers consolidate multiple years’ donations into one year to surpass the standard deduction threshold.  
- [ ] It is only permitted once every five years by the IRS.  
- [ ] It can only be used by wealthy individuals.  
- [ ] It is prohibited if the taxpayer also has mortgage interest deductions.  

> **Explanation:** Bunching multiple years’ worth of charitable contributions in a single tax year can push itemized deductions above the standard deduction, creating greater total tax savings over a multi-year span.
