## 25.4 Working with Private Letter Rulings & Technical Advice

Working with Private Letter Rulings (PLRs) and Technical Advice Memorandums (TAMs) can be a pivotal component of sophisticated tax compliance and planning for individuals and entities. A Private Letter Ruling enables taxpayers to secure the IRS’s interpretation and application of tax law to a specific set of facts before filing a tax return or finalizing a transaction. Technical Advice, on the other hand, helps resolve interpretational disputes or ambiguities that may arise during an IRS examination or appeals process. 

The IRS has established a precise framework dictating how rulings and advice should be requested, the content and structure of such requests, and the binding versus non-binding nature of the IRS’s responses. For CPA candidates preparing for the TCP (Tax Compliance and Planning) section of the Uniform CPA Examination, understanding the nuance, scope, and procedural rigor of PLRs and TAMs is essential. This segment explores the formal process for requesting Private Letter Rulings, the role of Technical Advice, and best practices for ensuring legally precise facts and well-structured questions.

## Introduction

PLRs and TAMs help shape the tax positions taken by entities and individuals, reinforcing predictability in tax outcomes. When a proposed transaction involves multiple tax issues or grey areas, a PLR can furnish significant assurance that the IRS will accept the chosen tax treatment, provided that the taxpayers follow through exactly as they presented the facts. Meanwhile, taxpayers or IRS examiners may request a TAM when interpretational uncertainties exist while an audit or examination is ongoing.

Key exam-related considerations include:
• Familiarity with the different types of rulings and their authoritative weight.  
• The procedural requirements for requesting PLRs or TAMs (fees, timelines, content).  
• Strategies for drafting carefully worded and forthright representations of the taxpayer’s scenario.  
• The effect of PLRs and TAMs on tax compliance, planning, and the potential for appeals or litigation.

In Chapter 21 (Practice & Procedure), we examined how the IRS handles audits, appeals, and court proceedings. This chapter builds upon those foundational concepts, unveiling how to engage more proactively with the IRS on interpretive matters through private rulings and technical advice.

## Understanding Private Letter Rulings

A Private Letter Ruling is a written statement the IRS issues to a specific taxpayer. It interprets and applies tax laws to the taxpayer’s particular factual situation. Although the PLR is binding only between the requesting taxpayer and the IRS, it can provide a sense of clarity or guidance on how the IRS might interpret rules for analogous cases. However, under the law, a PLR:
• Is prospective, meaning it generally does not apply retroactively unless specifically stated.
• Applies only when the taxpayer adheres strictly to the factual scenario laid out in the request.
• Is not legal precedent for other taxpayers.

### Key Benefits of Private Letter Rulings
• Certainty and Transparency: Taxpayers gain confidence in implementing complex or high-stakes transactions.  
• Risk Management: A ruling limits the possibility of contention with the IRS during future examinations on that issue, as it reflects an agreed-upon interpretation.  
• Potential Cost Savings: Upfront clarity may mitigate future legal fees or penalties related to interpretive disputes.

### When to Seek a Private Letter Ruling
Many taxpayers pursue PLRs in connection with:  
• Corporate restructurings, mergers, or spin-offs.  
• Estate and gift matters.  
• Section 1031 like-kind exchanges.  
• Partnership contribution or distribution transactions.  
• Foreign tax credit computations, treaty applications, or cross-border activities.  
• S corporation eligibility and distributive matters.

## Understanding Technical Advice Memorandums

Technical Advice Memorandums (TAMs) are IRS responses to requests for guidance on questions that arise during audits or appeals within a taxpayer’s ongoing case. Unlike PLRs, TAMs:  
• Are initiated by IRS field offices or appeals officers to address tax issues that lack clear precedent or involve unusual factual situations.  
• Do not necessarily bind the taxpayer if the taxpayer disagrees and chooses to pursue litigation.  
• Are similarly taxpayer-specific but can be referenced internally by the IRS for consistent application of tax laws.  

A TAM often resolves interpretational disputes, bridging disagreements between IRS examiners and taxpayers. In many respects, PLRs and TAMs can converge in complexity. However, the impetus to request a TAM tends to occur reactively during an audit, rather than proactively before the transaction.

## Distinguishing PLRs from TAMs

While both communications clarify tax interpretations, fundamental differences exist:

| Feature               | Private Letter Ruling (PLR)           | Technical Advice Memorandum (TAM)                |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Timing                | Proactive, often before a transaction | Reactive, during audit or appeals               |
| Requesting Party      | Taxpayer (with user fee)              | IRS Field Office or Appeals                     |
| Binding Effect        | Binding for requesting taxpayer only  | Fact-specific; used in active dispute           |
| Relevance to Others   | Not precedential but often used as guidance for similar facts | Internal reference for IRS staff; redacted versions in public domain |
| Applicable Scenarios  | Corporate reorganizations, estate gifts, complex transactions | Disputed or ambiguous tax positions under audit |

## Formal Request Process for Private Letter Rulings

Acquiring a PLR entails a strictly regulated submission process. The IRS details these procedures in various Revenue Procedures published annually. As of this writing, the procedures may be found in the relevant annual IRS Revenue Procedures (e.g., Rev. Proc. 2023-1 for the year 2023, then updated each year).

### Step 1: Review Current Guidance
Before investing time and money (including user fees), it is vital to thoroughly research whether the IRS has already published guidance (Regulations, Revenue Rulings, Revenue Procedures, or prior PLRs) addressing the taxpayer’s question. If clear guidance exists, a new PLR request might be denied or deemed unnecessary.

### Step 2: Draft the Letter Ruling Request
Requests must include:  
• Primary Taxpayer Information: Name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN).  
• Relevant Code Sections: Pinpoint the IRC provisions (and related regulations) at issue.  
• Statement of Facts: Present the proposed or completed transaction in detail, ensuring every meaningful fact is disclosed.  
• Issues to be Addressed: Clearly delineate the specific questions the taxpayer seeks to have answered.  
• Analysis and Authorities: Outline legal support for the taxpayer’s position, referencing IRC sections, regulations, court decisions, and IRS rulings.  
• Ruling Requested: State precisely what the taxpayer wants the IRS to confirm. Example: “Taxpayer respectfully requests a ruling confirming that the property exchange qualifies as a nontaxable transaction under IRC §1031.”  

### Step 3: Pay the User Fee
A user fee applies to PLR requests. The exact amount varies depending on the complexity of the request and the taxpayer’s gross income level. Revised schedules are published by the IRS each year. Generally, smaller businesses or individuals may pay a reduced fee. The request may be rejected or delayed if the requisite fee is not included.

### Step 4: Submit to the IRS (Centralized Mailing Address)
The request is sent to the IRS’s designated office—often the Associate Chief Counsel (Corporate) or National Office, depending upon the subject area. A cover letter typically highlights:  
• Fee payment.  
• Table of contents (if voluminous).  
• Signatures under penalties of perjury, attesting that the facts are truthful and complete.  

### Step 5: IRS Review and Requests for Additional Information
Upon receiving the request, the IRS assigns it for detailed review. During this phase, the IRS may:  
• Request additional documentation or clarification.  
• Schedule a conference of right, allowing the taxpayer or representative to present arguments in person.  

### Step 6: Formal Ruling Issuance
If approved, the IRS issues a written PLR elaborating on the analysis and concluding remarks. This final letter may include any caveats about conditions that invalidate the ruling (e.g., material misrepresentations). Once the taxpayer obtains the PLR, it is binding if all facts remain accurate and relevant law does not change.

## Formal Request Process for Technical Advice

While the taxpayer is typically an active participant, the formal request for Technical Advice is initiated by a field-processing IRS agent or appeals officer rather than the taxpayer. Still, the taxpayer can suggest or agree to this approach if there is a genuine interpretive dispute. Key points include:

• The local IRS office prepares a detailed request, including the facts, analysis, and references to law.  
• The taxpayer may provide input or comment on factual or legal statements.  
• The request goes to the National Office, which consults internally, sometimes conferring with specialized branches.  
• The ultimate advice is directed to the field or appeals office, which applies the advice to the taxpayer’s case.  

In some situations, taxpayers might desire to expedite or bypass local-level disputes by accelerating a TAM request. Though TAMs lack the forward-looking benefits of PLRs, they can definitively resolve interpretive conflict during an examination.

## Best Practices for Drafting Legally Precise Facts and Questions

### Presenting Comprehensive and Accurate Facts
When seeking a PLR, ensure absolute consistency with all relevant details:
• Chronology and vantage points of transactions.  
• Descriptions of legal entities, related parties, or trusts.  
• Financial statements that corroborate the transaction’s underlying economics.  

Any omission or misstatement of facts can invalidate the ruling, risking subsequent audits, penalties, or interest assessments. Thorough documentation is essential in persuading the IRS that the transaction is legitimate and accurately portrayed.

### Specificity in Questions
The best questions in PLR or TAM requests are those that:  
• Cite the exact IRC section or regulation in question.  
• Clearly articulate the interpretive conflict or statutory ambiguity.  
• Avoid hypothetical or overly broad queries.  
• Are framed around specific transactions or sets of transactions.  

For instance, asking, “Does Code Section 368 reorganization treatment apply to our proposed merger?” is precise. Asking, “Is this merger tax-free?” without referencing the controlling statute may not suffice, as it could encourage less focused IRS analysis.

### Supporting Legal Authority
Substantiate your position by exhaustively referencing relevant:
• IRC sections or subsections.  
• Final and temporary regulations.  
• Treasury guidance, such as Revenue Rulings or Procedures.  
• Pertinent judicial precedents from the U.S. Tax Court, District Courts, or Circuit Courts of Appeals.  

Citing analogous PLRs can be helpful, although they hold no precedential value. However, referencing them can demonstrate consistent IRS thinking.

### Clear Position Statement
Articulate your conclusion or interpretive stance directly. For instance:  
• “It is our position that the described series of distributions constitutes a partial liquidation under IRC §302(b)(4), as evidenced by…”  
• “We contend the proposed restructuring meets each statutory requirement of IRC §355 and is therefore tax-free, particularly in light of Revenue Ruling XXXX-XX.”

### Organizing Your Request
Use structured headings, subheadings, bullet points, and cross-references. This format fosters clarity for both the IRS reviewer and any subsequent examiner revisiting the ruling request.

### Maintaining Confidentiality
While the IRS publishes redacted versions of PLRs, be mindful of the possibility that certain details might become public in an anonymous format. If proprietary information is included, highlight it for safeguarding under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the extent allowed. The IRS typically honors valid confidentiality requests if they do not hamper clarity or public interest.

## Real-World Example: Corporate Reorganization

Imagine a mid-sized manufacturing corporation (MFG Co.) that plans to spin off an operating division into a separate company. The transaction is intended to qualify under IRC §355 but involves multi-step distributions and redemption of a minority shareholder’s stock. Uncertainty arises because the spin-off may inadvertently trigger unrelated or complex rules under IRC §306 (relating to stock with certain tax attributes).

MFG Co.’s tax counsel unearths minimal controlling guidance. The corporation decides to seek a PLR confirming that (1) the spin-off will qualify under §355 and (2) it will not subject the minority redemption to dividend treatment. They draft a detailed facts section, referencing corporate minutes, the impetus for the spin-off, the proprietary valuation studies, and prior IRS notices. In their legal analysis, they cite relevant rulings and provide a reasoned argument that the transaction meets each prong of §355. The submission includes user fees and the standard perjury statement. After a series of clarifying calls with the IRS, MFG Co. receives a favorable PLR, allowing the board to proceed with confidence.

## Potential Challenges and Pitfalls

• Requests Not Addressed by the IRS: Certain subjects are “no-rule” areas (e.g., subjective judgments like the reasonableness of compensation), so your request may be declined.  
• Changing Facts: If the actual transaction deviates from what was described, the ruling can be rendered invalid.  
• Passage of New Legislation or Retroactive Guidance: Tax law constantly evolves. Congress or the IRS may introduce subsequent law changes that overshadow a prior PLR.  
• Inadequate Legal Research: The IRS expects a thorough knowledge of existing rules. Shallow or incomplete analysis may result in a lengthy back-and-forth or denial.

## Exam Relevance for CPA Candidates

On the TCP exam, you are likely to see questions testing your comprehension of:  
• The difference between binding authority (Regulations, Revenue Rulings) and non-binding references (PLRs, TAMs).  
• The user fee system, timeframes, and content requirements for ruling requests.  
• The strategic timing of requesting a ruling or technical advice when planning a transaction or addressing an audit matter.  
• Ethical responsibilities in presenting facts accurately under penalties of perjury.  

Refer to Chapter 21 (Practice & Procedure) for broader details on audits and appeals. Additionally, see Chapter 25.1 for a deeper look at appeals controversies and alternative dispute resolution methods like Fast Track Settlement.  

Staying informed of the broader procedural context advanced in Chapter 25 can guide you in anticipating IRS controversies and resolving or preempting them through proactive rulings.

- [x] Written statements applying tax law to a taxpayer’s specific facts.  
- [ ] Precedential guidance that applies to all taxpayers.  
- [ ] IRS-approved general guidelines for the public.  
- [ ] Automatically applicable to all future tax years for any taxpayer.  

> **Explanation:** A Private Letter Ruling applies only to the requesting taxpayer’s unique factual scenario and provides a written statement of how the IRS interprets the law under those facts.

### Which of the following is a key distinction between a Private Letter Ruling (PLR) and a Technical Advice Memorandum (TAM)?

- [x] PLRs are generally sought before a transaction, while TAMs typically arise during an IRS examination or appeal.  
- [ ] PLRs are always directed to the taxpayer’s counsel, whereas TAMs are always directed to the IRS National Office.  
- [ ] TAMs are generally sought before a transaction, while PLRs typically address ongoing examinations.  
- [ ] TAMs are non-binding, but PLRs are binding on all taxpayers.  

> **Explanation:** PLRs are requested proactively by the taxpayer to gain certainty on a future or ongoing transaction, whereas TAMs are typically requested by IRS examiners during an audit or appeal to resolve specific interpretive issues.

### A primary requirement for securing a Private Letter Ruling from the IRS is:

- [x] Paying the appropriate user fee based on the taxpayer’s size or transaction complexity.  
- [ ] Having at least 100 employees.  
- [ ] Demonstrating that no prior PLRs exist on the issue.  
- [ ] Filing a petition with the U.S. Tax Court.  

> **Explanation:** User fees must be paid as part of the PLR request process. Failure to include the fee may result in rejection of the request.

### If a taxpayer’s factual circumstances change after the IRS issues a PLR:

- [x] The ruling may become invalid, requiring a new or revised PLR request.  
- [ ] The ruling automatically applies to the new or changed facts.  
- [ ] No action is needed; the PLR will always remain valid.  
- [ ] The taxpayer can request a TAM to replace the PLR.  

> **Explanation:** A PLR is predicated on the veracity and permanence of the facts presented. Any material change risks invalidating the ruling.

### Which statement about PLRs and potential legislation changes is correct?

- [x] A PLR can be overshadowed by later legislative or administrative changes.  
- [ ] A PLR automatically supersedes newly enacted legislation.  
- [ ] A PLR remains valid so long as the taxpayer requests an extension each year.

- [ ] Avoiding any user fees if the amount in question is under $1 million.  
- [ ] Gaining the right to apply the ruling to all similarly situated taxpayers.  

> **Explanation:** A key advantage of a PLR is reduced risk in subsequent audits for that specific transaction. The IRS has already taken an affirmative position, assuming facts do not change.

### The formal request for a TAM typically originates from:

- [ ] The taxpayer’s external counsel only.  
- [x] An IRS field office or appeals officer.  
- [ ] A federal court judge.  
- [ ] The state department of revenue.  

> **Explanation:** A TAM is requested by the examining agent or an appeals officer when tax issues remain unresolved during an audit or appeal, although the taxpayer can participate and provide input.

### Which of the following is NOT a best practice for drafting a PLR request?

- [ ] Including a detailed statement of facts and relevant financial data.  
- [x] Presenting contradictory facts to create a broad ruling scenario.  
- [ ] Citing and analyzing all applicable Internal Revenue Code sections.  
- [ ] Submitting a clear ruling request specifying the interpretation sought.  

> **Explanation:** Contradictory or incomplete facts can invalidate the ruling or cause confusion. The request must be factually consistent and precise.

### Why might referencing prior PLRs in a request be valuable, even though they are not precedential?

- [x] They show how the IRS has treated similar factual situations and demonstrate consistent thinking.  
- [ ] They bind the IRS to issue the same result again.  
- [ ] They are considered official regulations.  
- [ ] They reduce the required user fee for the request.  

> **Explanation:** While PLRs do not set legal precedent for other taxpayers, referencing them may illustrate patterns in IRS reasoning and lend persuasive support to your request.

### The binding power of an issued PLR is:

- [x] Limited to the specific taxpayer and specific facts outlined in the request.  
- [ ] Applicable to all taxpayers engaging in transactions under the same IRC section.  
- [ ] Equivalent to a Supreme Court decision.  
- [ ] Legally unenforceable.  

> **Explanation:** A PLR only binds the IRS and the requesting taxpayer for the specific facts and transaction described. It does not apply to any other taxpayers or any material change in facts.
