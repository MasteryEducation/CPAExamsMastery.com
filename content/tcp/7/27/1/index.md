## 27.1 Business Valuation & Estate Freezes (FLPs, GRATs)

Effective estate planning often involves strategic techniques that preserve and transfer wealth in a tax-efficient manner. Two popular methods—Family Limited Partnerships (FLPs) and Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)—enable individuals to “freeze” the value of assets in their estates and shift future appreciation to heirs. By employing a proper valuation approach, leveraging discounts associated with limited partnership interests, and using grantor trust structures, taxpayers can substantially reduce their overall transfer tax liability. This section explores the concepts of business valuation, FLPs, and GRATs, illustrating how each strategy can shift appreciation out of the taxable estate.

### Introduction to Business Valuation in Estate Planning

When dividing or transferring interests in a closely held business or any investment entity, determining the fair market value (FMV) of the assets or business is a critical step. The objective is to ascertain the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, both of whom have a reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts and neither under any compulsion to buy or sell.

• Purpose in Estate Planning  
  Business valuation is essential to compute taxable gift or estate values when transferring assets. Under Chapter 6 (see “Transfers During Life – Gift Taxation & Strategy”), the fair market value drives the gift tax calculation when assets are given away, and under the estate tax framework, it determines the gross estate’s tax base.

• Common Valuation Approaches  
  1. Market Approach: Compares the business to similar, publicly traded or privately sold entities.  
  2. Income Approach: Often uses the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, projecting future earnings and discounting them back to a present-value figure.  
  3. Asset Approach: Values each component (assets and liabilities) on a fair market basis and aggregates the results.  

Factors such as a lack of control (minority interest) and lack of marketability can further reduce the valuation, significantly impacting beneficial tax results when transferring partial interests to family members or trusts.

### Family Limited Partnerships (FLPs)

A Family Limited Partnership is a legal entity often formed by parents or older generation family members (the General Partners) to consolidate family business interests or investment assets. Limited partnership interests are subsequently transferred to children or other family members (the Limited Partners) in a structure designed to manage assets effectively while minimizing transfer taxes.

#### Key Features and Advantages of FLPs

• Centralized Management and Control  
  FLPs allow founding partners (often parents) to retain control over day-to-day operations, decisions, and investment strategies as General Partners (GPs), without necessarily giving away management rights to the younger generation as Limited Partners (LPs).

• Valuation Discounts  
  LP interests often carry lower valuations for estate and gift tax purposes due to:  
  – Lack of Control Discount: Limited Partners generally have no say in critical decisions.  
  – Lack of Marketability Discount: FLP interests are typically not traded on public markets, making them less liquid.  
  These discounts can reduce the taxable “fair market value” of transferred interests.

• Asset Protection  
  Properly structured FLPs may offer protection from potential creditors by keeping certain assets inside the partnership, separate from personal liabilities.

• Consolidation of Family Assets  
  An FLP centralizes family wealth under one entity for more effective stewardship. This can facilitate centralized asset management and future generational transfers.

#### Mechanics of an FLP

The following diagram provides a simplified overview of an FLP structure:

```mermaid

    A[Founder/Parent(s)] --> B[Family Limited Partnership]
    B --> C[General Partner Interest]
    B --> D[Limited Partnership Interests]
    D --> E[Children / Trusts]
```

1. Formation: The founders (parents or older generation) contribute assets—cash, marketable securities, real estate, a family business, or a combination—to the FLP.  
2. Partnership Interests: The FLP agreement outlines GP and LP ownership. The GP(s) control and manage the FLP while LPs typically have minimal voting or management rights.  
3. Transfer of Interests: The founding partners can gift or sell LP interests to children, trusts for children, or other family members. Because of potential discounts, transferring LP interests often leverages a reduced taxable gift.  
4. Ongoing Management: The General Partner(s) decide on distributions, reinvestment of earnings, and critical business decisions.  

#### The Estate Freeze Using FLPs

An FLP serves as a powerful estate freeze technique because any future growth in the value of LP interests accrues predominantly outside the older generation’s taxable estate (once those LP interests are legally transferred). The parents freeze their stake at the current reported valuation (subject to discounts), while the partnership’s continued growth in asset value occurs in the hands of the children or trusts.

For example, consider a family business valued at $5 million. The parents form an FLP, contribute the business, and retain a 1% GP interest plus a 99% LP interest. Then the parents gift 80% of the LP interests (discounted for valuation purposes) to their children’s trust. Over time, if the FLP business appreciates to $10 million, most of that appreciation in the LP interests is outside the parents’ estate.

#### Potential Pitfalls and IRS Challenges

• IRS Scrutiny of Discounts  
  The IRS may argue that discounts claimed for lack of control or marketability are excessive if it believes the partnership structure is purely for tax avoidance. It’s crucial that the FLP has a valid business purpose, such as asset protection or consolidated management.  

• Disguised Gifts or Step Transactions  
  If the IRS perceives the partnership formation and asset transfers as part of a single plan lacking economic substance, it may collapse those steps, resulting in disallowed discounts or increased gift tax.  

• Retained Control Risk  
  Overreaching control or inadequate adherence to partnership formalities (e.g., not respecting GP-LP distinctions or commingling personal funds) can jeopardize the intended tax advantages.  

• Capital Requirements  
  The GP’s exposure to liability may be higher if the GP interest is structured to reflect day-to-day management responsibilities.

### Shifting Appreciation Through Estate Freezes

An estate freeze is a technique where a taxpayer “freezes” the current value of an asset in their own estate while transferring future appreciation (growth) to heirs. FLPs are one method, but there are others as well. The objective is to reduce the taxable estate at death by removing the growth in asset value from the parents’ estate, while still retaining enough control or cash flow to support themselves financially.

Common Estate Freeze Elements:

• A Senior Interest that is “frozen” in value (typically through limited growth potential or preferred returns).  
• A Junior Interest that captures any upside or growth in the underlying assets.

### Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)

GRATs are a specialized trust structure that allow a grantor to potentially remove substantial wealth from their estate with minimal or no gift tax implications. The grantor sets up a trust and transfers assets into it while retaining the right to receive annuity payments for a set period. After that period, any remaining assets in the trust pass to beneficiaries (often children) free of additional gift tax consequences, to the extent growth is above the “hurdle rate” set by the IRS (Section 7520 rate).

#### Mechanics of a GRAT

Below is a simplified diagram of how a GRAT functions:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Grantor] --> B[GRAT]
    B --> D[Annuity Payments (to Grantor)]
    B --> C[Remainder to Beneficiaries]
```

1. Creation of the GRAT: The grantor contributes assets expected to appreciate significantly (e.g., stocks, partnership interests, startup shares) into the trust.  
2. Annuity Stream: In exchange, the trust is required to pay an annuity back to the grantor for a predefined term (e.g., two to five years).  
3. Remainder to Heirs: If the assets grow faster than the IRS’s assumed rate of return, the excess growth stays in the GRAT. At the end of the annuity term, any remaining assets pass to the beneficiaries—often children or trusts for their benefit—essentially free of extra gift tax.  

#### Zeroed-Out GRATs

One commonly used technique is the “zeroed-out” or “near-zeroed-out” approach, wherein the initial value of the remainder interest is set very low to minimize gift tax. By setting the annuity payments high enough, the taxable gift to the remainder beneficiaries is close to zero. If the assets appreciate above the IRS hurdle rate, the extra value ends up in the hands of the beneficiaries without triggering significant gift tax.

#### How GRATs Freeze Estate Values

During the GRAT term, all future appreciation above the annuity payout effectively shifts out of the grantor’s estate to the trust beneficiaries. The grantor’s taxable gift is calculated at the inception of the trust, using the Section 7520 rate. If the assets outperform that rate, the “excess” appreciation is removed from the grantor’s estate.

#### Potential Risks with GRATs

• Early Death of the Grantor  
  If the grantor passes away during the GRAT term, the trust assets generally revert to the grantor’s estate, negating much of the intended tax benefit.  

• Legislative or Regulatory Changes  
  GRATs have been a topic of proposed legislative amendments, such as minimum trust terms or mandatory remainder values. Future legislation could restrict zeroed-out GRATs or impose additional limitations.  

• Performance Risk  
  If the contributed assets do not outperform the IRS hurdle rate, the GRAT simply returns little or no benefit to beneficiaries.  

• “Mortality Risk” in Long-Term GRATs  
  A longer term increases the chance for higher appreciation but also heightens the risk that the grantor may not outlive the trust term.

### Coordination Between FLPs and GRATs

Combining FLPs and GRATs can be particularly powerful:

1. The FLP: Creates discounted interests that can be transferred more efficiently.  
2. The GRAT: Receives these discounted interests, further enhancing the leverage if such interests appreciate beyond the hurdle rate.  

For instance, an individual might first form an FLP with growth-oriented assets (e.g., private business shares, real estate, or marketable securities with high upside). They value the LP interests with applicable discounts and transfer these LP interests into a GRAT. If those LP interests soar in value, the excess growth remains in the GRAT and eventually goes to beneficiaries at a fraction of the estate or gift tax cost.

---

### Best Practices

• Establish a Valid Non-Tax Purpose  
  Whether creating an FLP or GRAT, demonstrate that the vehicle serves more than mere tax avoidance. For FLPs, maintain separate records, observe formalities, and articulate legitimate business or investment goals.

• Use Expert Valuations  
  Retain qualified valuation professionals who understand relevant valuation discounts and can produce a defensible report. Carefully document minority discounts, lack-of-marketability discounts, and the overall rationale.

• Consider Term Lengths for GRATs  
  Shorter-term “rolling GRATs” may mitigate mortality risk (though they must consider transaction costs and complexity). Alternatively, somewhat longer terms can lock in assets for a more extended growth period.

• Monitor Changing Laws  
  Estate planning strategies can shift quickly with new tax legislation. Work with qualified tax professionals, staying informed about proposed changes that can alter the effectiveness or legality of zeroed-out GRATs or the permissible scope of partnership discounts.

• Pay Attention to Family and Succession Goals  
  Beyond taxes, design FLPs and GRATs to fit broader family objectives. Who will manage the family business? How do you address potential disputes among siblings or extended family members? Comprehensive planning is crucial.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

Case Study 1: Family Real Estate FLP  
A parent holds several real estate properties valued at $8 million. By forming an FLP, the parent retains a 2% GP stake and transfers a 98% LP stake. Through formal appraisal, the LP interests might receive a combined discount of 30% for lack of control and marketability, thereby reducing the $7.84 million LP value (98% of $8 million) to around $5.488 million for gift tax purposes. These LP interests are gradually gifted to an irrevocable trust for the children. Over 10 years, the properties appreciate to $15 million, and most of that appreciation remains outside the parent’s taxable estate.

Case Study 2: Rolling GRAT for Startup Shares  
A founder of a tech startup believes the company is poised for explosive growth. She creates a series of 2-year GRATs and contributes shares in each round. The IRS sets the hurdle rate at 4%. After each 2-year term, the founder receives her annuity back, typically in shares or cash, while any appreciation beyond 4% remains in the trust, eventually passing to her children. This “rolling” approach mitigates risk if the founder dies during any particular term while capturing substantial gains if the shares skyrocket.

### Diagrams and Tables to Enhance Understanding

Using diagrams can clarify the flow of interests between the grantor, trust structures, and beneficiaries. We have already seen mermaid diagrams illustrating FLP and GRAT structures. Tables are also helpful to showcase how discounted valuations affect overall estate and gift calculations.

Example Table: Impact of Valuation Discounts on a Hypothetical LP Gift

| Description                 | Value Without Discount | 30% Discount Applied |  
|-----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|  
| FLP Interests Gifted        | $5,000,000            | $3,500,000          |  
| Applicable Gift Tax Rate(*) | 40%                   | 40%                 |  
| Theoretical Gift Tax        | $2,000,000            | $1,400,000          |  
| Tax Savings                 | ––                    | $600,000            |  

(*) Actual rates and calculations can vary based on exemption limits, lifetime credit usage, and other factors.

## Test Your Knowledge: Estate Freezes, FLPs, and GRATs

{{< quizdown >}}

### Which of the following is a primary characteristic of a Family Limited Partnership (FLP) in estate planning?

- [ ] It is a publicly traded partnership with limited partners.  
- [x] It consolidates family assets and applies valuation discounts for transfer tax benefits.  
- [ ] It eliminates the need for formal partnership agreements.  
- [ ] It does not require a general partner to control day-to-day operations.  

> **Explanation:** FLPs are often used to centralize family holdings, reduce estate tax exposure via valuation discounts, and allow older generation family members to retain management control.  

### What is the main goal of an estate freeze strategy?

- [x] To shift the future appreciation of assets to beneficiaries and minimize estate taxes.  
- [ ] To increase taxable gifts as quickly as possible.  
- [ ] To consolidate personal and business assets into a single irrevocable trust.  
- [ ] To prevent investment appreciation or capital gains.  

> **Explanation:** An estate freeze locks the present value in the senior generation’s estate while transferring future growth to heirs. The aim is to reduce estate taxes on the appreciation that occurs after the transfer.  

### Why are valuation discounts, such as lack of control and lack of marketability, important in FLP transfers?

- [ ] They increase the gift tax liability for the general partner.  
- [x] They can reduce the fair market value of transferred interests, lowering gift tax costs.  
- [ ] They have no impact on the fair market value.  
- [ ] They are only relevant for publicly traded corporations.  

> **Explanation:** FLP interests typically qualify for discounts due to lack of control and marketability, decreasing the valuation and thereby reducing the taxable amount of a gift.  

### In a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT), why is the “zeroed-out” concept so significant?

- [ ] It ensures a high initial gift tax amount on the remainder interest.  
- [ ] It means the grantor pays no estate tax for 10 years.  
- [x] It helps minimize the taxable gift at the outset while still shifting future asset growth.  
- [ ] It eliminates the need for annuity payments.  

> **Explanation:** Zeroed-out GRATs set the annuity payment so that the taxable gift is (nearly) zero, maximizing the potential for estate-free asset growth if the trust’s investments outperform the IRS hurdle rate.  

### What is the main risk if a grantor of a GRAT dies before the end of the GRAT term?

- [ ] The beneficiaries receive an accelerated distribution of assets.  
- [ ] The IRS will impose penalties on the trustee.  
- [x] The trust assets revert to the grantor’s estate, reducing the intended tax benefits.  
- [ ] The grantor loses control over future annuity payments.  

> **Explanation:** If the grantor dies prematurely, the trust assets typically become includible in the grantor’s estate, diminishing or forfeiting expected transfer tax advantages.  

### Why might families choose to combine FLPs with GRATs?

- [ ] To create multiple trusts, each with its own management.  
- [ ] To avoid compliance with partnership formalities.  
- [x] To further leverage valuation discounts before transferring assets to a GRAT for additional growth removal.  
- [ ] To eliminate the need for estate planning attorneys.  

> **Explanation:** By first placing assets in an FLP to apply discounting, and then transferring the discounted FLP interests to a GRAT, families can amplify the effect of shifting future appreciation out of the estate.  

### Which of the following best describes the IRS “hurdle rate” under a GRAT?

- [x] The assumed interest rate set under IRC §7520 that assets must beat to yield estate-planning benefits.  
- [ ] The minimum annual return required by the SEC for company dividends.  
- [ ] The maximum permissible discount on FLP valuation.  
- [ ] The estate tax rate applied to high net worth donors.  

> **Explanation:** The Section 7520 rate is set monthly by the IRS and represents the hurdle for GRAT asset growth; returns exceeding this rate pass to beneficiaries tax-free.  

### What is one potential downside of forming an FLP solely for tax benefits without a legitimate business purpose?

- [ ] It locks in the value and eliminates estate taxes entirely.  
- [ ] It absolves the family from filing annual partnership returns.  
- [x] The IRS may view the partnership as lacking economic substance and deny discounts.  
- [ ] The family permanently avoids capital gains taxes on FLP assets.  

> **Explanation:** The IRS can rescind the tax benefits of an FLP if it lacks legitimate non-tax reasons and operational substance, deeming it a sham or step transaction.  

### Which of the following is a valid best practice when implementing an FLP?

- [x] Actively maintain partnership formalities and separate bank accounts.  
- [ ] Avoid drafting a written partnership agreement.  
- [ ] Comingle personal assets with the FLP to simplify transactions.  
- [ ] Eliminate all general partner control to maximize discounts.  

> **Explanation:** FLPs must be treated as legitimate business entities, with formalities and separate accounts. Failing to do so can risk an IRS challenge and loss of the intended benefits.  

### A “zeroed-out” GRAT’s main advantage lies in:

- [x] The ability to give away future asset appreciation at minimal or no gift tax cost.  
- [ ] A guaranteed maximum estate tax rate once the grantor dies.  
- [ ] A requirement that beneficiaries pay the annuity.  
- [ ] Exemption from all state gift tax requirements.  

> **Explanation:** “Zeroed-out” GRATs allow the grantor to pay little or no initial gift tax, while any excess growth above the hurdle rate passes to beneficiaries free of gift taxes once the annuity term ends.
