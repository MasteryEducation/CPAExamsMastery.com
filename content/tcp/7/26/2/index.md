## 26.2 Energy Efficiency Credits (Renewable Energy, Electric Vehicles)

In today’s rapidly evolving tax environment, energy efficiency credits have become a focal point for both individual taxpayers and corporate entities. As the global economy shifts toward more sustainable practices, the U.S. tax code has responded with expanding offerings for energy-related incentives. These credits encourage the adoption of renewable energy systems, electric vehicles (EVs), and various energy-efficient improvements. From a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) perspective, understanding how to accurately apply these credits—and properly account for their basis reductions, recapture triggers, and filing requirements—is vital for effective tax compliance and planning under the Uniform CPA Examination (TCP) guidelines.

This section addresses the key “must-know” concepts for the exam and for real-world practice. We will discuss current legislative frameworks, eligibility requirements, filing protocols, recapture provisions, basis reduction implications, and best practices in claiming these valuable incentives.

---

### Overview of Energy Efficiency Credits

The U.S. tax code offers numerous incentives designed to encourage both individuals and businesses to invest in green technologies. Among the most prominent are credits related to:

• Renewable Energy Installations (e.g., solar, wind, and geothermal)  
• Electric Vehicle Purchases or Leases  
• Alternative Fuel Refueling Infrastructure  
• Energy-Efficient Home Improvements  

These credits—often known by their corresponding Internal Revenue Code (IRC) sections (e.g., IRC §25D for residential energy credits, §30D for qualified EV credits, §45 and §48 for investment credits)—are nonrefundable credits, meaning they can offset tax liability down to zero but generally do not result in a refund if the credit exceeds one’s total liability. Any unused portion may often carry forward, typically for a specified number of years.

---

### Legislative Context and Recent Changes

Keeping abreast of new legislation is crucial for the CPA candidate. In recent years, legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and prior acts have significantly modified various energy credits:

• Rebranded and extended the credit for purchasing electric vehicles, imposing new battery and assembly requirements.  
• Extended and expanded the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar energy installations and other renewable programs.  
• Created (or renewed) credits for commercial clean vehicles, advanced manufacturing of energy components, and expanded rules for used EVs.  

Since these provisions are subject to sunset clauses, annual adjustments, or technical corrections, candidates must stay current and refer to Chapter 20 (Recent Legislative Developments & Sunset Provisions) for evolving details.

---

### 1. Renewable Energy Credits

Renewable energy credits, often referred to as the Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit (IRC §25D) and the Business Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC under IRC §48), incentivize adoption of clean energy systems. Common technologies include solar panels (photovoltaics), solar water heaters, small wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and fuel cell properties.

#### 1.1 Eligibility and Credit Amounts

• Residential (IRC §25D): Taxpayers who install a qualifying system in their primary residence or second home may be eligible for a percentage-based credit on qualified expenditures. Historically, these percentages have fluctuated (e.g., 30%, 26%, 22%) depending on the installation year and legislative updates.  
• Business (IRC §48): For corporate taxpayers, the ITC generally offers a credit on the cost of installing renewable systems, subject to phasedowns and specific technology qualification.

#### 1.2 Filing and Documentation

Individual taxpayers typically claim the residential energy credit on Form 5695, whereas businesses claim the ITC on Form 3468. Detailed records must be retained, including receipts, proof of the property’s eligibility, and any certifications from the manufacturer to verify compliance with federal standards.

#### 1.3 Basis Reduction Issues

When a renewable energy credit is claimed, the basis of the qualified property must be reduced by the amount of the credit. For example, if a taxpayer installs a solar photovoltaic system costing $20,000 and claims a 30% credit, the $6,000 credit reduces the depreciation basis of the system to $14,000 if placed in service for business use. This reduction can be significant for future depreciation calculations or future capital gains/loss events.

#### 1.4 Recapture Provisions

Recapture may apply if the renewable energy property ceases to qualify (e.g., sold or otherwise disposed of) before the end of the “compliance period.” Under IRC §§48 and 50, the recapture percentage typically phases out over five years for business energy property. For residential property, recapture is less common for personal residence expenditures, but one must confirm the requirements of each credit.

### 2. Electric Vehicle Credits

Electric Vehicle (EV) and Alternative Fuel Vehicle credits have evolved over time, shifting from the Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit to the “Clean Vehicle Credit” under IRC §30D. The overarching aim is to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by encouraging the adoption of zero- or low-emission vehicles.

#### 2.1 IRC §30D: Clean Vehicle Credit

Historically known as the “Plug-In Electric Drive” credit, §30D has been extended and revised by recent legislation. Key elements often include:

• A credit of up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles, subject to battery capacity, final assembly location, and the buyer’s income level.  
• Income caps for high-income taxpayers, making higher earners ineligible.  
• Manufacturer sales thresholds replaced by requirements that take into account where batteries are produced or sourced.  
• Potential for point-of-sale reductions with certain dealers.  

##### 2.1.1 Example Calculation  

Suppose a taxpayer purchases a qualifying EV with a battery capacity meeting the threshold for the full $7,500 credit. The taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income is below the stated threshold, and the vehicle satisfies final assembly requirements. In this scenario, the taxpayer may claim the entire $7,500 credit on Form 8936, reducing their tax liability to zero if sufficient liability exists.

#### 2.2 IRC §25E: Used Electric Vehicle Credit

Recent legislative changes introduced a credit for the purchase of previously owned (used) EVs. Lower than the new vehicle credit, it often stands at a lesser amount (e.g., up to $4,000), and specific requirements around the vehicle’s sale price and the buyer’s income exist.

#### 2.3 Commercial EV Credit (IRC §45W)

Businesses that purchase qualified commercial vehicles (e.g., electric delivery vans, semi-trucks) can benefit from a separate credit not restricted by the personal income thresholds relevant to individual taxpayers. The credit is often a percentage of the incremental cost difference between a traditional vehicle and the clean alternative, up to specified limits.

#### 2.4 Basis Adjustments and Depreciation

For business or commercial vehicles, when a tax credit is claimed (e.g., IRC §30D or §45W), the vehicle’s depreciable basis is reduced by the amount of the credit. This reduction directly affects future depreciation deductions. While nonbusiness vehicles do not require depreciation basis adjustments for personal use, taxpayers should be mindful of potential capital gain or recapture implications if they later convert the vehicle into business use or resell it quickly.

#### 2.5 Recapture Rules

Although typically less likely for personal-use vehicles, recapture can apply in specific scenarios. For business vehicles, if the vehicle is disposed of or ceases to meet the credit’s qualifying criteria during a specified retention period (often several years), a portion of the credit may be recaptured in proportion to the time remaining in the recapture window.

---

### 3. Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit (IRC §30C)

IRC §30C incentivizes the installation of charging stations for electric vehicles or other alternative fuel infrastructure. Both individuals (for home-based systems) and businesses (for commercial or fleet charging) benefit from a credit equal to 30% of the cost of qualified refueling property, subject to statutory caps.

• Annual limits: The credit may be capped (e.g., $1,000 for residential installations, $30,000 for commercial).  
• Recapture: If the taxpayer ceases to use the property for qualified purposes before the end of five years, recapture in proportion to the time remaining applies.  
• Business Facilities: Commercial locations installing multiple ports or advanced charging/fueling systems must track cost allocations carefully and may benefit from broader renewable incentives in conjunction with the property.

---

### 4. Coordination with Other Credits & Deductions

An important aspect for CPAs is ensuring that taxpayers do not “double dip.” Generally:

• You cannot claim two different tax credits for the same expenditure.  
• You cannot claim both a tax credit and a deduction (such as Section 179 expensing) for the same portion of an asset’s basis.  
• Overlapping Federal, state, and local incentives may exist, but each has its own compliance requirements.

For example, if a business installs a solar array and claims the §48 ITC, the basis of that system is reduced by the credit amount prior to calculating depreciation or a Section 179 expense deduction. Similarly, if claiming a credit under §30C for installing an EV charging station, the portion used for the credit may not qualify for additional energy-related deductions unless explicitly allowed.

---

### 5. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### 5.1 Meticulous Recordkeeping

To claim credits effectively and prepare for any potential IRS examination, thorough documentation is crucial:

• Keep purchase receipts, detailed invoices, and manufacturer certifications of eligibility.  
• Maintain accurate logs of the date placed in service, usage, and cost breakdowns (particularly for partial business use).

#### 5.2 Ensuring Proper Property Classification

Mistakes can arise when categorizing property (e.g., mistaking personal property for business property, or incorrectly interpreting partial business use). In the event of an audit, confusion in classification can trigger recapture or disallowed credits.

#### 5.3 Monitoring Legislative Updates

As the scope and structure of energy efficiency credits continue to evolve, it is imperative to keep up-to-date. For instance, new legislation may tighten or expand the provisions of EV credits, add or modify residency or usage requirements, or introduce new classifications for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or other emerging technologies.

#### 5.4 Overclaiming or Underclaiming Credits

Common errors include:

• Claiming credits without confirming the property meets all technical requirements (e.g., correct battery capacity in an EV).  
• Incorrectly applying phaseouts, assembly, or sourcing rules for EVs.  
• Failure to reduce basis for assets receiving the credit.

### 6. Illustrative Case Study

Below is a simplified scenario showcasing common issues and solutions.

#### Case: The GreenTech Corporation

GreenTech Corporation invests in a rooftop solar array and a fleet of electric delivery vans:

1. Solar Investment  
   • Cost: $500,000  
   • Eligible Credit: 30% under IRC §48.  
   • Credit Claimed: $150,000 (30% of $500,000).  
   • Adjusted Basis: $500,000 – $150,000 = $350,000. GreenTech will use $350,000 as the basis for MACRS depreciation.  

2. Electric Fleet  
   • GreenTech purchases five electric vans, each qualifying for a $7,500 credit under §30D (assuming each meets final assembly, battery sourcing, and other statutory requirements).  
   • Total Credit Claimed: 5 × $7,500 = $37,500.  
   • Each vehicle’s depreciable basis is reduced by $7,500 for tax purposes.  

3. EV Charging Stations  
   • Cost to install: $150,000 for a multi-port charging station.  
   • Credit: 30% of $150,000 = $45,000 under IRC §30C, subject to a maximum of $30,000 per location (if the relevant legislative rules are in effect).  
   • Recapture Potential: If the station is sold or repurposed to a nonqualifying use within five years, GreenTech will face partial recapture.  

Outcome:  
GreenTech Corporation significantly reduces its federal tax liability through these energy credits. However, it must handle basis reductions, potential recapture events if property is disposed of prematurely, and ensure compliance with any usage restrictions.

### 8. Summary and Key Takeaways

1. Energy credits are significant tax incentives encouraging eco-friendly decisions, but each program has distinct qualification hurdles.  
2. Basis reduction is typically required by the credit amount, impacting future depreciation or gain calculations.  
3. Recapture provisions enforce compliance during a specified retention or usage period. If property no longer qualifies, all or part of the credit may be forfeited.  
4. CPA candidates should be well-versed in the relevant IRC sections, up-to-date legislative changes, and accurate return preparation.  
5. Thorough recordkeeping, correct classification, and an understanding of credit interplay are essential elements for successful compliance.  

By mastering these areas—particularly the statutory language, filing nuances, and recapture or basis adjustments—candidates will be well-prepared for both the Uniform CPA Examination’s Tax Compliance and Planning (TCP) section and real-world practice advising clients on energy efficiency incentives.
