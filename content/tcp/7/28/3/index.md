## 28.3 Multi-State Apportionment Worksheets & Partnerships

Multi-state taxation can become significantly more complex when dealing with partnerships. Each partner’s distributive share of income and deductions may need to be apportioned or allocated across multiple jurisdictions, particularly if the partnership operates or derives income from more than one state. In this section, we explore essential concepts, including:

• Property, payroll, and sales factor weighting forms side-by-side  
• Partial nexus arising from expansions into new states  
• Best practices for tracking and reporting multi-state items  
• Practical worksheets, schedules, and examples to clarify computational techniques  

Comprehending these nuances is crucial when preparing multi-state returns and ensuring all relevant jurisdictions collect their fair share of tax. This also helps avoid double taxation or unintended over-reporting of income in multiple states.

### Introduction to Multi-State Apportionment for Partnerships

Unlike corporations, which file at the entity level for certain taxes, partnerships generally pass their income, deductions, credits, and other items to their partners through the Schedule K-1. However, each partner may have distinct filing obligations in every state in which the partnership has established nexus. A state’s nexus criteria often include having property, payroll, or sales sourced there at or above a certain threshold, but specific rules differ among states.

#### Core Apportionment Factors

1. **Property Factor**  
   Typically represents the proportion of the partnership’s owned or rented property in a state relative to all property used in the organization’s trade or business.

2. **Payroll Factor**  
   Reflects the amount of compensation paid to employees working in a particular state relative to the total compensation paid to all employees.

3. **Sales Factor**  
   The ratio of a partnership’s sales or revenue sourced in a given state over the total sales or revenue of the partnership. Many states use various “market-based sourcing” rules to determine where revenues are sourced, especially for intangible products or services.

---

### The Typical Three-Factor Apportionment Method

Each factor—property, payroll, and sales—may be weighted as follows:  
• Equally weighted (each factor is weighted one-third).  
• Double-weighted sales factor (common in many states).  
• Sales-only factor (single-sales factor states).  

The **traditional three-factor formula** is often expressed as:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Apportionment Percentage} = \frac{ \left( \frac{\text{Property}_\text{in State}}{\text{Total Property}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{Payroll}_\text{in State}}{\text{Total Payroll}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{Sales}_\text{in State}}{\text{Total Sales}} \right)}{3}
{{< /katex >}}

If states weight the factors differently (e.g., double-weighted sales), the apportionment formula must reflect the adjusted weighting.

### Multi-State Apportionment Worksheets: Side-by-Side Comparison

Below are examples of simplified side-by-side worksheets for property, payroll, and sales factors. These forms can be adapted to each state’s specific weighting rules. Reviewing these forms side by side can help ensure completeness and catch discrepancies early.

#### Property Factor Worksheet

| Description                     | Total Across Partnership | State A       | State B       | State C       |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Owned Real Property (avg. cost)| $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| Owned Personal Property (avg.) | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| Rented Property (capitalized)  | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| --------------------------------| ------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Total Property**             | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| **Property Factor**            | \-                       | = StateA /Total | = StateB/Total |= StateC/Total |

Many states require you to capitalize rented property at a multiple of the annual rent (often eight times the net annual rental). Compute the average property value by adding the beginning and end-of-year property values and dividing by two (if required by state law).  

#### Payroll Factor Worksheet

| Description                     | Total Across Partnership | State A       | State B       | State C       |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Salaries & Wages               | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| Bonuses & Commissions          | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| Other Compensation             | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| --------------------------------| ------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Total Payroll**              | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| **Payroll Factor**             | \-                       | = StateA /Total | = StateB /Total |= StateC /Total |

The payroll factor generally includes all forms of compensation for employees in each state. Measurement can be complicated if an employee works in multiple states. Some states apply “time-based” or “duty-based” allocations for employees who cross state boundaries.  

#### Sales (Receipts) Factor Worksheet

| Description              | Total Across Partnership | State A       | State B       | State C       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Tangible Product Sales   | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| Service Revenue          | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| Royalty/License Fees     | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| Other Income             | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| -------------------------| ------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Total Sales**          | $XX,XXX,XXX             | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   | $X,XXX,XXX   |
| **Sales Factor**         | \-                       | = StateA /Total | = StateB /Total |= StateC /Total |

Depending on the nature of the business, the sourcing of intangible income like royalties and services can differ from tangible goods sourcing, which typically uses destination-based rules (where the goods are delivered or shipped).

### Partial Nexus: Business Expansion and Mid-Year Apportionment

When a partnership decides to expand into a new state mid-year, complex “partial nexus” considerations may apply. Some states require an apportionment methodology that divides the period before establishing nexus from the after-nexus period; others simply measure property, payroll, and sales for the entire tax year and compute an overall ratio.

#### Example Scenario: Partial Nexus from Mid-Year Entry

• XYZ Partnership begins operating exclusively in State A on January 1.  
• On July 1, XYZ Partnership expands into State B, renting an office and hiring local staff.  
• By December 31, the partnership has recognized 50% of its total annual sales from the new State B office.  

State B typically requires that all income recognized after nexus is established be apportioned according to the same property/payroll/sales ratio. This may lead to a “double-layer” approach:  
1. Apportion pre-nexus income 100% to State A.  
2. Apportion post-nexus income using the combined property, payroll, and sales factors for the period post-July 1.  

Some states might simply compute an annual average for property and payroll, and attribute the appropriate portion of sales to the period post-expansion. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Because each jurisdiction’s rules differ, comprehensive worksheets that track monthly or quarterly data often become essential.

### Practical Example: Applying Multi-State Apportionment

Consider a partnership, ABC LLP, that operates in three states: X, Y, and Z. Each state uses an equally weighted three-factor formula except State Y, which double-weights the sales factor. Let’s work through a condensed illustration:

1. **Aggregate Factors**

   | Factor   | Amount in X | Amount in Y | Amount in Z | Total        |
   |----------|------------|------------|------------|--------------|
   | Property | $2,000,000 | $3,000,000 | $1,000,000 | $6,000,000   |
   | Payroll  | $1,000,000 | $1,000,000 | $2,000,000 | $4,000,000   |
   | Sales    | $3,000,000 | $5,000,000 | $2,000,000 | $10,000,000  |

2. **Computing Each Factor Ratio**  

   - Property Factor by State:  
     • X: $2M / $6M = 33.33%  
     • Y: $3M / $6M = 50.00%  
     • Z: $1M / $6M = 16.67%  

   - Payroll Factor by State:  
     • X: $1M / $4M = 25.00%  
     • Y: $1M / $4M = 25.00%  
     • Z: $2M / $4M = 50.00%  

   - Sales Factor by State:  
     • X: $3M / $10M = 30.00%  
     • Y: $5M / $10M = 50.00%  
     • Z: $2M / $10M = 20.00%  

3. **Combine Factors**  
   - State X (equally weighted 3-factor ratio):  
     Apportionment % = (33.33% + 25.00% + 30.00%) / 3 = 29.44%  

   - State Y (double-weighted sales factor):  
     Apportionment % = (50.00% + 25.00% + (2 × 50.00%)) / (1 + 1 + 2)  
     = (50.00 + 25.00 + 100.00) / 4  
     = 175.00 / 4  
     = 43.75%  

   - State Z (equally weighted 3-factor ratio):  
     Apportionment % = (16.67% + 50.00% + 20.00%) / 3 = 28.89%  

4. **Determine Taxable Income in Each State**  
   If ABC LLP’s total taxable income subject to apportionment is $1,000,000, the portion allocated to each state is:  
   - X: 29.44% of $1,000,000 = $294,400  
   - Y: 43.75% of $1,000,000 = $437,500  
   - Z: 28.89% of $1,000,000 = $288,900  

These assigned income amounts flow through to each partner, who must then determine their filing obligations based on residency, credit for taxes paid to other states, and each state’s rules applicable to partnership pass-through entities.

### Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

1. **Ignoring the Details of Nexus Thresholds**: Each state has distinct criteria for establishing nexus. Not monitoring sales or payroll thresholds can result in missed filing requirements.  

2. **Incorrectly Applying Single vs. Multi-Factor Methods**: Some states might adopt a single-sales-factor approach; others use a variation of the three-factor approach. Carefully verify the weighting method.  

3. **Misclassifying Sales Across States**: For services, states often use market-based sourcing or cost-of-performance sourcing. Confirm which method is valid in each jurisdiction to avoid over- or under-reporting sales.  

4. **Partial Nexus & Mid-Year Entry**: Underestimating the complexity of expansions or acquisitions can cause errors in attributing income to the newly added state(s).  

5. **Consistent Record-Keeping**: Monthly or quarterly data capture is essential for accurate factor computation.  

**Best Practices**:  
• Maintain meticulous records of property, payroll, and sales by state.  
• Set a monthly or quarterly schedule to update apportionment worksheets.  
• Involve state and local tax (SALT) specialists whenever significant expansions or reorganizations occur.  
• Cross-verify factor computations with prior-year returns to identify unusual swings.  

---

### Strategies for Partnerships with Rapid Growth

• **Early Nexus Analysis**: Conduct a robust nexus study before entering a new state to understand potential tax obligations.  
• **Evaluate Pass-Through Entity Taxes (PTETs)**: An increasing number of states have introduced elective pass-through entity taxes that can simplify or alter the apportionment dynamic, influencing partners’ SALT deduction limits.  
• **Leverage Technology**: Cloud-based accounting systems can automatically tag sales, payroll, and property expenses by location, streamlining factor computation.

## Mastering Multi-State Apportionment: A Comprehensive Quiz

{{< quizdown >}}

### In which scenario does a partnership typically need to file a state return?

- [x] When the partnership has nexus in that state based on property, payroll, or sales.  
- [ ] Only if at least five partners reside in that state.  
- [ ] When the partnership’s total income exceeds $500,000.  
- [ ] Only in the state where the partnership was originally formed.  

> **Explanation:** Partnerships generally must file a state return (or an informational partnership return) when they have nexus, which can result from owning or renting property, employing workers, or making sales in the state—regardless of the number of partners who live there.

### When calculating the property factor for apportionment, how is rented property commonly included?

- [x] Multiply the net annual rent by a standard capitalization approach (e.g., by 8).  
- [ ] Add the monthly rent to the total mortgage balance.  
- [ ] The annual rent is divided by 12.  
- [ ] Rented property is never included in property factor calculations.  

> **Explanation:** Rented property is often capitalized at a specific multiplier (such as 8) times the net annual rental. This figure is then added to the property owned for purposes of the property factor.

### What is a partial nexus situation?

- [x] When a business establishes nexus in a new state partway through the tax year.  
- [ ] When a partner relocates from one state to another.  
- [ ] When the partnership has no physical presence anywhere.  
- [ ] When the partnership has pass-withholding obligations for one partner only.  

> **Explanation:** Partial nexus occurs if a partnership begins to do business in a new state mid-year, meaning the partnership is liable for income generated after the date nexus is established.

### Which factor is most commonly weighted more heavily in states that do not use an evenly weighted three-factor formula?

- [x] The sales factor  
- [ ] The property factor  
- [ ] The payroll factor  
- [ ] The intangible factor  

> **Explanation:** Many states have switched to a heavier sales factor or even a single-sales-factor method to encourage in-state employment and property investment.

### When an employee works in multiple states, which approach is often used to attribute payroll to each state?

- [x] Time-based or duty-based allocations proportionate to work performed in each state.  
- [ ] The single state with the highest wages for that employee is used.  
- [x] Commuter-state tax credit allocations.  
- [ ] No allocation is needed; allocate to the partnership’s home state only.  

> **Explanation:** In multi-state scenarios, time or duty-based allocations are used to calculate the percentage of payroll wages attributable to each state. State-by-state rules differ, but the principle of attributing compensation based on the location of the services performed is common.

### Which best describes the correlation between partner-level filing obligations and partnership multi-state apportionment?

- [x] The partnership’s apportionment data flows to the partners, who use it to determine their own multi-state filing requirements.  
- [ ] Partners are only responsible for filing in their state of residence, irrespective of the partnership.  
- [ ] Only the partnership has to file in each relevant jurisdiction; individual partners need not file anything additional.  
- [ ] Partners should always file in any state the partnership touches, regardless of apportionment.  

> **Explanation:** Partnerships provide K-1s with the allocation and apportionment information, enabling each partner to determine in which states they must file and possibly claim credits for taxes incurred in other states.

### Which of the following is a common pitfall in multi-state apportionment?

- [x] Failing to verify each state’s sourcing rules for service income.  
- [ ] Recording property, payroll, and sales on a monthly basis.  
- [x] Using professional tax software for factor calculations.  
- [ ] Depreciating property consistently in all states.  

> **Explanation:** One of the most misunderstood areas is service income sourcing, as states can use cost-of-performance or market-based rules, leading to confusion if not correctly identified and applied.

### Which factor is not typically part of the standard three-factor apportionment formula?

- [x] Intangible factor  
- [ ] Property factor  
- [ ] Payroll factor  
- [ ] Sales factor  

> **Explanation:** The standard formula often includes property, payroll, and sales factors. Intangible factor is not usually considered separately (although intangible income sourcing is a different but related topic).

### What is the primary function of apportionment worksheets?

- [x] They provide a structured means to calculate the property, payroll, and sales ratios for each state.  
- [ ] They only track employee headcount for each state.  
- [ ] They are used solely by single-member LLCs to track guaranteed payments.  
- [ ] They eliminate the need to file in certain states.  

> **Explanation:** Apportionment worksheets help a partnership systematically collect the necessary data (property, payroll, sales) to compute ratios and ensure accurate determination of multi-state taxable income.

### True or False: Some states offer a single-sales-factor apportionment model, effectively ignoring property and payroll factors.

- [x] True  
- [ ] False  

> **Explanation:** Many states have shifted toward a single-sales-factor apportionment model to encourage businesses to locate property and payroll in their states without incurring higher apportionment of income.
