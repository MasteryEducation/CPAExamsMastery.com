## 16.2 §754 Elections & Step-Ups in Basis on Transfers & Distributions

A partnership’s ability to align its “inside basis” in assets with a “new” partner’s outside basis is often critical to tax planning and compliance. Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) allows a partnership to make an election that triggers basis adjustments to partnership assets—both in the context of partnership interest transfers and distributions. By utilizing a §754 election, partnerships can mitigate potential tax disparities that arise when a partnership interest changes hands or when certain distribution events take place. In this section, we explore the fundamental provisions that enable these basis step-ups (or step-downs), highlighting common triggers such as a partner’s death or sale of an interest, and illustrate how newly admitted partners can accurately track their inside basis in the partnership’s assets.

This topic integrates with Chapters 11 (Partnerships & LLCs) and 16 (Partnership & LLC Tax Planning) by providing the bridge from core formation and operational rules to the advanced planning strategies that rely on basis adjustments under §754. Additionally, this section builds upon concepts introduced in earlier chapters related to entity choice, pass-through taxation, and recognition of gains or losses on disposition events.

  
## Introduction to the §754 Election

When a partnership interest changes hands—due to a sale, exchange, or the death of a partner—a discrepancy can arise between the outside basis of the incoming or remaining partnership interest and the inside basis of the partnership’s underlying assets. Normally, the partnership would not change the inside basis of its assets in response to a transfer of an interest, resulting in a mismatch. However, IRC §754 allows the partnership to elect to adjust these disparity-driven mismatches by:

• Increasing or decreasing the adjusted basis of the partnership’s assets in the instance of a transfer of a partnership interest (IRC §743(b)).  
• Increasing or decreasing the adjusted basis of remaining partnership assets following certain distributions (IRC §734(b)).  

A valid §754 election together with corresponding adjustments under either §734(b) or §743(b) aligns the new outside basis with the partnership’s inside basis. This alignment ensures that items of income, deduction, depreciation, and gain or loss associated with the partnership’s assets are more accurately reported at both the partnership and partner levels.

  
## Typical Triggers for a §754 Election

Although a partnership may make a §754 election in any tax year that a triggering event occurs, two common scenarios prompt partnerships to consider filing a §754 election:

1. Sale or Exchange of a Partnership Interest (IRC §743(b))  
   – A selling partner disposes of their interest by sale or exchange to a new or existing partner.  
   – A portion of a partner’s interest is redeemed by the partnership, resulting in a new partner’s outside basis that differs from the inside basis of the underlying assets.

2. Distribution of Property to a Partner (IRC §734(b))  
   – A distribution leads to a recognized gain or loss at the partnership level.  
   – If the distribution significantly changes the distributee’s outside basis without adjusting the inside basis of the partnership assets, a disparity between outside and inside basis can develop for the remaining partners.

A third scenario—partner death—is typically categorized under a transfer of interest. When a partner passes away, their estate (or beneficiaries) steps into their partnership interest at a basis equal to its fair market value (FMV) on the date of death (or alternative valuation date). This event frequently triggers a §754 election because the newly inherited outside basis is often significantly higher (or lower) than the decedent’s prior outside basis.

  
## Step-Ups (or Step-Downs) in Basis on Transfers

### Sale or Exchange (IRC §743(b) Adjustments)

Under §743(b), when a partnership interest is sold or exchanged (or passes through inheritance), the new partner’s outside basis generally reflects the purchase price or inherited basis. Without a §754 election, the partnership’s inside basis remains unchanged. This mismatch can cause either under- or over-allocation of income, deductions, or gains when the assets are subsequently sold.

• Key Concept: A §743(b) adjustment applies solely to the new partner(s) or the transferee(s). It does not affect the entire partnership’s inside basis from the perspective of those who remained partners before and after the transaction.  

• Mechanics of §743(b) Step-Up:  
  – The partnership compares the outside basis of the new partner’s interest to that partner’s share of the current inside basis in the partnership’s assets.  
  – The difference is the basis adjustment, which can be either a step-up or a step-down.  
  – The adjustment is allocated among partnership assets under the rules of §755 (and related Treasury Regulations), typically beginning with capital gain property or “hot assets.”  
  – The partnership must maintain records of this special basis adjustment for the transferee partner, and it generally only benefits (or burdens) that partner.

### Example: Partner Sale  
Suppose Partner A sells their 30% interest in XYZ Partnership to Partner D for $600,000 at a time when Partner A’s outside basis was $400,000. Without a §754 election, the partnership’s inside basis in XYZ’s assets remains unchanged, leading to a mismatch for D. With a §754 election in place, the partnership compares D’s outside basis ($600,000) with D’s share of the inside basis ($400,000 × 30% = $120,000 difference from the new buyer’s perspective, factoring in the fair valuation of the entire partnership). The result is a $480,000 disparity or “spread” that must be allocated among XYZ’s assets to align inside and outside basis for D.

In reality, the calculation can be more complex because the partnership must measure the FMV of each asset relative to basis, identify built-in gains or losses, and allocate the adjustment in accordance with IRS rules. However, the result is that D can effectively get a steeper depreciation or a smaller gain upon eventual sale of the underlying assets, correlating with the premium D paid to acquire the partnership interest.

  
## Step-Ups in Basis on Distributions

### Distribution Adjustments (IRC §734(b) Adjustments)

When a partnership makes certain distributions that trigger gain or loss at the partnership level, IRC §734(b) allows an inside basis step-up (or step-down) under a valid §754 election. This typically occurs in two primary situations:

1. **Distribution in Excess of Basis**: A partner may receive a distribution that reduces their outside basis to zero but still triggers recognized gain at the partnership level.  
2. **Distribution of Appreciated Assets**: If the partnership distributes appreciated property leading to the partner recognizing a gain or adjusting their basis, the partnership might also adjust the basis of its remaining assets to prevent distortion of future gains and losses.

### Impact on Remaining Partners  
Although §743(b) adjustments generally benefit (or burden) only the transferee partner, §734(b) adjustments from distributions can affect the basis of assets for all remaining partners. This helps ensure that the partnership’s overall inside basis reflects economic reality after major distributions, reducing the risk of double taxation or duplicated losses in future transactions.

  
## Tracking Inside Basis Adjustments

Once a §754 election is made, the partnership must carefully track the special basis adjustments for each relevant partner (under §743(b)) on transfers and collectively for the entire partnership (under §734(b)) following qualifying distributions. Maintaining clear records is critical; poor recordkeeping is a frequent pitfall in partnership tax returns.  
 
### Internal Recordkeeping

Many partnerships employ robust tracking methods, such as:

• Separate “sub-accounts” detailing each partner’s share of the inside basis.  
• Year-by-year “build-up” schedules depicting how the basis adjustment affects depreciation or amortization.  
• Cross-referencing partner capital accounts with special basis adjustments to ensure synchronization.  

### Newly Admitted Partner’s Perspective

When a new partner acquires an interest (through purchase or inheritance) in a partnership that has a valid §754 election in place, that partner may see a step-up in inside basis that matches their higher outside basis. Effectively, the new partner’s share of depreciation or amortization on partnership assets will reflect their purchase price or inherited stepped-up basis. This prevents the new partner from being taxed on gains attributable to a period before they joined the partnership.

  
## Calculation Mechanics

At the heart of a §754 election lie two parallel but distinct sets of rules under IRC §§734 and 743.  
 
1. **Section 743(b) Calculation** (Transfers):  
   – Identify the transferee partner’s outside basis in the acquired partnership interest.  
   – Compute the transferee’s share of the partnership’s inside basis (before adjustment).  
   – The difference is the §743(b) adjustment.  
   – Allocate this adjustment among assets consistent with built-in gain or loss at the time of transfer under §755.

2. **Section 734(b) Calculation** (Distributions):  
   – Calculate the amount of gain or loss recognized by the partner or the partnership, if any, upon distribution.  
   – Identify the difference between the partner’s adjusted outside basis and the inside basis of distributed assets.  
   – Adjust the basis of the partnership’s remaining assets (collectively, from the perspective of continuing partners) for this difference.

These adjustments generally follow a hierarchy that favors assets likely to produce ordinary income or recapture (e.g., “hot assets”) before applying leftover basis to other capital or §1231 property. 

  
## Visual Flow of Basis Adjustments

Below is a simplified Mermaid diagram illustrating how a partnership’s inside basis can be adjusted when a partner’s interest is transferred:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A((Transfer Event)) --> B{§743(b) Trigger}
    B --> C[Determine Incoming Partner's Outside Basis]
    C --> D[Compare With Partner's Share of Inside Basis]
    D --> E[(Difference = §743(b) Adjustment)]
    E --> F[Allocate Among Partnership Assets per IRC §755]
    F --> G([Record & Track the Adjustment for the Transferee Partner])
```

In practice, the partnership may maintain multiple special basis adjustments for different partners who have joined at different times and under different valuations.

  
## Real-World Example: Partner’s Death & Newly Admitted Partner

Consider ABC Partnership, which has three equal partners (A, B, and C) each holding a 33⅓% interest. Partner A passes away, and the fair market value of the entire partnership is determined to be $1.5 million on A’s date of death. A’s outside basis was only $300,000 before death.

• The estate of A inherits this partnership interest with a stepped-up basis of $500,000 (33⅓% of $1.5 million).  
• Without a §754 election, ABC would not adjust its inside basis. If the estate immediately sells that interest to Partner D for $500,000, D’s outside basis is $500,000, but D would effectively inherit the share of ABC’s inside basis consistent with the historical cost basis of $300,000.  
• With a §754 election in place, ABC can now make a §743(b) adjustment that increases the estate or D’s share of inside basis by $200,000 ($500,000 – $300,000).  
• Upon the sale, D steps into a $500,000 outside basis matched by an inside basis of $500,000 in the underlying assets from D’s perspective.

The resulting alignment prevents any potential tax distortion that might arise if ABC sells or disposes of its assets in the future. D effectively only pays tax on gains accrued from the time of D’s ownership forward, rather than incurring gain that accrued before entering the partnership.

  
## Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

### Pitfalls

• **Failure to File the Election Timely**  
  The §754 election is typically made by attaching a statement to the partnership’s timely filed return (including extensions) for the year of the transfer or distribution. Missing this window often requires requesting relief from the IRS, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

• **Omission of Step-Down**  
  Never ignore adjustments that result in a basis decrease. Although less desirable, step-downs are mandatory once a valid election is in place if a disparity indicates a negative adjustment.

• **Complex Allocations Under §755**  
  The allocation of adjustments among various classes of assets can be intricate, especially for partnerships owning multiple categories of assets (e.g., tangible property, intangible property, and “hot assets” subject to recapture). Mistakes in allocation can lead to over- or under-reporting of income, with associated penalties.

• **Poor Recordkeeping**  
  Failing to maintain precise schedules for individual step-up (or step-down) allocations can create confusion in later years, especially when the partnership experiences multiple changes in ownership over time.

### Best Practices

• **Anticipatory Planning**  
  Partnerships with frequently changing ownership—such as those with older partners or in active M&A environments—often find it prudent to adopt a standing §754 election, thus avoiding the administrative scramble in years with triggering events.

• **Detailed Capital Account Schedules**  
  Maintain separate “sub-accounts” for each partner’s special basis adjustments. This ensures clarity in computing future depreciation, amortization, or gain/loss on disposal.

• **Periodic Reviews**  
  Because partnership agreements and ownership percentages may shift every few years, a regular audit of step-up computations, allocated depreciation, and partner basis statements can help in avoiding expensive errors.

• **Consult Professional Guidance**  
  CPAs or attorneys well-versed in partnership taxation should be engaged, especially when partnerships own complex assets or intangible properties requiring specialized valuation.
