## 13.1 C Corp vs. S Corp vs. Partnership vs. LLC: Tax Impact & Liability

Choosing the right legal entity is one of the most critical decisions when establishing or restructuring a business. Each structure—C Corporation (C Corp), S Corporation (S Corp), Partnership, or Limited Liability Company (LLC)—carries distinct implications for taxes, liability, and ownership flexibility. These differences can significantly affect cash flow, distribution strategies, self-employment tax exposures, capital-raising options, and more.  

In this section, we explore how double taxation compares to pass-through taxation, examine potential liability protections, highlight ownership constraints, and assess self-employment tax treatment. We also include practical examples, diagrams, tables, and best practices to help you make more informed choices. This content aligns with the Uniform CPA Examination Blueprints (Effective date: January 2025) for Tax Compliance and Planning (TCP), especially within the context of entity tax planning and formation strategies.

### The Big Picture: Formation & Tax Regime

Understanding the distinctions among C Corps, S Corps, Partnerships, and LLCs begins with how each entity is formed and taxed.

• C Corp: Formed under state law, recognized as a separate taxpaying entity. Subject to corporate income tax, with shareholders taxed again when dividends are distributed.  
• S Corp: Formed similarly to a C Corp but elects S status for pass-through taxation (part of Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code). Typically does not pay federal corporate tax; profits flow to shareholders’ individual returns.  
• Partnership: Formed with two or more owners who agree to operate a business. Profits “pass through” to partners’ personal returns. Partnerships file an information return (Form 1065).  
• LLC: An entity authorized under state law. By default, a multi-member LLC is taxed as a partnership; a single-member LLC is disregarded for tax (treated as a sole proprietorship if owned by an individual). However, an LLC can elect to be taxed as a C Corp or S Corp.

Each classification has unique tax ramifications and liability protections. Let’s start with one of the most defining features: double taxation versus pass-through mechanics.

---

### Double Taxation vs. Pass-Through Mechanics

Arguably the most significant distinction among these entity types lies in whether an entity is subject to corporate-level income tax.  

#### C Corporation: Double Taxation
A C Corp is separate from its owners for tax purposes. It files Form 1120 and pays taxes on its taxable income at the corporate level. When the C Corp distributes earnings to its shareholders as dividends, shareholders are taxed again (on their individual returns). This results in the “double tax” phenomenon:
1. Corporate income is taxed once at the corporate level.  
2. Dividends are taxed again at the shareholder level.  

Qualified dividends for individual shareholders may benefit from a preferred rate (often up to 20% depending on the taxpayer’s marginal bracket), but the fundamental idea is two layers of taxation.

#### S Corporation: Pass-Through Treatment
An S Corp generally does not pay federal income tax at the corporate level (some states vary). Instead, the S Corp files an informational return (Form 1120-S) and passes income, losses, deductions, and credits to individual shareholders proportionally. Shareholders then report these amounts on their personal returns (Form 1040). While S Corps avoid double taxation at the federal level, there may be exceptions such as built-in gains taxes or excess passive income tax if the S Corp has certain leftover C Corp attributes.  

#### Partnerships: Pass-Through Treatment
Partnerships themselves do not pay federal income tax. They file an information return (Form 1065) that allocates the partnership’s income, deductions, and credits to each partner via a Schedule K-1. Each partner reports their share on their personal tax return (e.g., Form 1040). The partnership model is highly flexible in allocating income, losses, and distributions, subject to the substantial economic effect rules under §704(b) and potential limitations.

#### LLCs: Flexible Classification
An LLC’s tax treatment is generally as a pass-through entity (a partnership for multi-member LLCs; a disregarded entity for single-member LLCs). However, LLCs can elect corporate treatment via Form 8832 (Entity Classification Election) and can further elect subchapter S if they meet S Corp requirements. In practice, many LLC owners favor pass-through tax treatment, but certain strategic scenarios might favor a C Corp election (e.g., for QBI planning, raising capital, or certain corporate-level benefits).

### Ownership & Formation Constraints

Ownership constraints can be crucial in deciding which entity structure is feasible or optimal.

Below is a table comparing ownership constraints across these four entities:

| Entity Type    | Ownership Constraints                                                       | Formation Requirements                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C Corp**     | No limit on number or type of shareholders. Foreign, domestic, individual, or corporate shareholders allowed. | Incorporated under state law. Must file Articles of Incorporation.            |
| **S Corp**     | Maximum of 100 shareholders. Only U.S. citizens or residents, certain trusts, estates. No corporate or partnership shareholders (with some exceptions). | Must first form a C Corp and then elect S status with IRS (Form 2553). State-level filing as a corporation. |
| **Partnership**| Must have at least two partners. Partners can be individuals, corporations, LLCs, or other partnerships.          | Typically governed by a partnership or operating agreement; legal registration may be required depending on the state. |
| **LLC**        | Single-member or multi-member. Generally open to individuals, corporations, or other entities. Some states restrict certain professions or industries. | File Articles of Organization with the state. Operating agreement recommended. |

#### Why Ownership Constraints Matter
• International Investors: If a business expects or desires foreign investment, a C Corp or an LLC (with C Corp election) might be more suitable, since S Corps prohibit foreign owners.  
• Growth Trajectory: If raising capital from venture capitalists or private equity is a future goal, C Corps are often favored due to familiarity and ease of issuing multiple classes of stock.  
• Family Businesses: S Corps are often chosen for small, closely held, U.S.-only family businesses. Partnerships or LLCs can also be structured for multi-generation estate planning.  

---

### Liability Protections

From a legal standpoint, personal liability protection for business debts and obligations often drives entity choice.  

• **C Corp and S Corp**: Both structures provide a liability shield for shareholders, preventing personal assets from being used to satisfy corporate liabilities (absent fraud or personal guarantees).  
• **Partnership**: Traditional general partnerships do not protect partners from personal liability for business debts. However, Limited Partnerships (LPs) or Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) can limit liability for some or all partners.  
• **LLC**: Offers liability protection for its members similar to that of a corporation, without the requirement to follow as many corporate formalities. States vary on specific protections and legal precedents, but generally, an LLC is recognized as a separate legal entity capable of shielding personal assets.

---

### Potential Self-Employment Taxes

Self-employment tax (SECA) affects how active owners of pass-through entities pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on their share of business earnings.  

• **C Corp**: Shareholders are not typically subject to self-employment tax on corporate dividends, but they must pay employment taxes as employees on wages. Salaries or wages to owner-employees are subject to FICA (employer and employee side).  
• **S Corp**: Shareholder-employees must receive a reasonable salary for services provided. The salary portion is subject to employment tax (FICA), while the remaining pass-through income distributions are generally not subject to self-employment taxes. The IRS closely scrutinizes S Corps that pay owner-employees a minimal salary to avoid payroll taxes.  
• **Partnership**: General partners (and some LLC members taxed as partnerships) pay self-employment tax on their share of ordinary business income from the partnership. The total net income allocated is often subject to self-employment tax unless the partner is a limited partner under carefully structured arrangements.  
• **LLC**: If taxed as a partnership, the self-employment rules mirror those of a partnership. If the LLC is taxed as an S Corp, the same “reasonable salary” principle applies.

Below is a simplified table comparing self-employment tax considerations:

| Entity Type    | Self-Employment Tax Considerations                                                                                                                                                             |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C Corp**     | Shareholders who are employees must pay FICA (Social Security/Medicare) on wages. Dividends are not subject to self-employment or payroll taxes but are subject to double taxation at corporate & individual levels. |
| **S Corp**     | Owners who perform services must take a reasonable salary (subject to FICA). Any additional net income (Schedules K-1) is typically exempt from self-employment taxes but taxed at the individual’s marginal rate.  |
| **Partnership**| General partners are generally subject to SE tax on their distributive share of partnership income. Limited partners may have reduced SE tax obligations, but special rules determine whether partner is deemed “limited.” |
| **LLC**        | If electing partnership taxation, members generally pay self-employment tax on the distributive share. If taxed as S Corp, must pay a reasonable salary to members providing services, with remainder as distributions. |

### Illustrating the Tax Flow (Mermaid Diagram)

The following Mermaid diagram summarizes the flow of corporate income and how it reaches the owners under each structure, emphasizing differences between double taxation and pass-through approaches.

```mermaid

```

Explanation of diagram flow:  
• For C Corps, income is taxed first at the corporate level (B) and then again at dividends distribution (D).  
• S Corps, Partnerships, and LLCs that elect pass-through status are not subject to federal corporate income tax (with some exceptions) and instead pass income through to the owners’ personal returns (G, J, N).

### Detailed Look at Each Entity Type

#### C Corporation

1. **Taxation**: Subject to a corporate tax rate under the IRC (often a flat rate, e.g., 21% as of this writing). Shareholders pay tax on dividends.  
2. **Advantages**:  
   • Potential for unlimited growth via multiple classes of stock  
   • Attractive to institutional and foreign investors  
   • Well-established legal precedent in all states  
3. **Disadvantages**:  
   • Double taxation can be costly  
   • Inflexible corporate formalities (e.g., annual meetings, board minutes)  
   • Mindful planning required to avoid trapped earnings  

#### S Corporation

1. **Taxation**: Income, losses, deductions, and credits pass through to shareholders. Generally no corporate-level tax, but watch out for built-in gains tax if converting from C Corp to S Corp.  
2. **Advantages**:  
   • Avoid double taxation at the entity level  
   • Ability to minimize self-employment tax on distributions (subject to “reasonable salary” rules)  
   • Liability protection similar to C Corp  
3. **Disadvantages**:  
   • Strict eligibility: max 100 shareholders, no foreign or corporate owners (generally)  
   • Only one class of stock (voting differences allowed, but no differing economic rights)  
   • Increased scrutiny around shareholder salaries  

#### Partnership

1. **Taxation**: Pass-through by default. Partnerships file Form 1065. Income is allocated on Schedule K-1 and taxed at the partner’s individual rate.  
2. **Advantages**:  
   • Flexible allocation of income, losses, and distributions (substantial economic effect rules apply)  
   • Generally simpler in terms of corporate formalities  
   • Multiple entity types can be partners  
3. **Disadvantages**:  
   • General partners subject to self-employment tax for their share  
   • Liability can be unlimited for general partners unless structured as an LLP or LP  
   • Complexity in recourse vs. nonrecourse debt allocation  

#### Limited Liability Company (LLC)

1. **Taxation**: By default, single-member LLCs are disregarded entities, and multi-member LLCs are taxed as partnerships. However, an LLC can elect corporate or S Corp status.  
2. **Advantages**:  
   • Limited personal liability for members (similar to corporate shareholders)  
   • Flexibility to choose taxation method (partnership, S Corp, or C Corp)  
   • Fewer state-imposed corporate formalities  
3. **Disadvantages**:  
   • Varying state rules regarding tax treatment or additional fees (e.g., franchise taxes)  
   • Some investors or lenders may prefer a C Corp structure for standardized transactions  
   • Potential complexity if multiple members desire different tax treatments

### Comparative Case Studies

Below are two simplified scenarios illustrating how entity choice can have real-world implications:

#### Case Study 1: Fast-Growing Tech Startup
• Founders plan to raise funds from angel investors and venture capital firms.  
• International investors may also be interested.  
• Founders want to retain earnings to reinvest in R&D rather than distributing dividends.  

In this scenario, a C Corp is often the default because:  
• It supports unlimited shareholders, including foreign investors.  
• Venture capitalists prefer a C Corp structure for legal and administrative familiarity.  
• Retained earnings remain with the corporation, and there is potential to leverage lower corporate rates.  

While pass-through entities might avoid double taxation, they tend to be less flexible in meeting VC expectations. Additionally, many institutional investors have legal or policy restrictions against investing in pass-throughs, making C Corp status more suitable.

#### Case Study 2: Family-Operated Business with Active Owners
• A family of three siblings opens a consulting partnership.  
• They want liability protection but also want business profits to flow through directly to them in a tax-efficient manner.  

An LLC with pass-through taxation might be ideal here:  
• Limited liability for each sibling.  
• Simple pass-through taxation via Schedule K-1, with each sibling paying tax on their share of income.  
• Flexibility in allocation of profits and losses under the operating agreement, subject to economic effect rules.  

Alternatively, if they wanted to reduce self-employment tax, an S Corp election could help, but they would need to ensure that each sibling receives a reasonable salary for services. The administrative overhead is slightly higher than a pure partnership but can yield payroll tax savings.

### Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

1. **Review State Requirements**: The tax benefits of an entity type can differ by state. For instance, some states impose franchise or margin taxes.  
2. **Maintain Corporate Formalities**: Even LLCs and S Corps must keep clear records. Ignoring formalities can lead to piercing the corporate veil.  
3. **Assess Future Growth Needs**: If you anticipate raising capital or selling to a strategic buyer, the corporate structure might yield better outcomes. If you want flexibility in the distribution of profits and losses, a partnership or LLC might fit better.  
4. **Reasonable Compensation**: For S Corps, paying unreasonably low salaries to avoid FICA taxes is a common trigger for IRS audits.  
5. **Converting Entities**: Conversions from one structure to another (e.g., C to S, LLC to S Corp) can trigger unexpected tax consequences, such as built-in gains. Proper planning and professional advice are critical.

### Practical Tips for CPA Exam Preparation

• **Know the Forms**: Familiarize yourself with Forms 1120 (C Corp), 1120-S (S Corp), 1065 (Partnership), and 8832 (Entity Classification). The exam may test your understanding of filing requirements and deadlines.  
• **Understand the Flow of Income**: Expect questions on how pass-through income is reported (Schedules K-1, 1120-S, 1065) and the difference between that and double taxation.  
• **Focus on Eligibility Rules**: S Corp eligibility is a frequent area of testing, including knowledge of acceptable shareholders, timely elections, and the 100-shareholder limit.  
• **Stay Updated**: Keep an eye on any legislative changes that may alter entity-level tax rates, self-employment tax rules, or pass-through deduction frameworks.

## Quiz: Choosing Business Entities for Tax Efficiency

{{< quizdown >}}

### Which is the primary difference between C corporation taxation and S corporation taxation?  
- [ ] C corporations have single-layer taxation, while S corporations have double taxation.  
- [ ] S corporations require unlimited shareholders, while C corporations cap shareholder count.  
- [x] C corporations have double taxation, while S corporations generally have pass-through taxation.  
- [ ] S corporations are subject to a higher corporate tax rate than C corporations.  

> **Explanation:** A C Corp pays corporate-level tax on earnings, and shareholders pay tax again upon receiving dividends, resulting in a double tax. S Corps, by contrast, typically avoid entity-level taxation (subject to certain exceptions) and pass items through to shareholders’ individual returns.

### Under which circumstance might a C corporation structure be most beneficial?  
- [x] When the entity plans to issue stock to a large number of foreign or institutional investors.  
- [ ] When the entity wants to limit the total to 100 shareholders and avoid double taxation.  
- [ ] When the entity wants only one class of stock.  
- [ ] When ensuring no personal liability is a lower priority.  

> **Explanation:** C corporations can generally have an unlimited number of shareholders, including foreign investors and institutions. This makes them ideal for businesses seeking venture capital or a broad pool of investors.

### For which entity type are owners typically required to take a “reasonable salary” if they perform services for the business?  
- [ ] C Corporation  
- [ ] Partnership  
- [x] S Corporation  
- [ ] Sole Proprietorship  

> **Explanation:** The IRS requires S Corp shareholder-employees to take a reasonable salary on which employment taxes are paid. This prevents the avoidance of payroll taxes by taking “distributions” in lieu of wages.

### Which of the following statements about partnership taxation is correct?  
- [ ] Partnerships pay a flat corporate tax on net income and then issue dividends.  
- [x] Partnerships pass income, deductions, and credits through to partners for reporting on their individual income tax returns.  
- [ ] Partnerships are taxed exactly like S corporations with respect to self-employment taxes.  
- [ ] Partnerships cannot have corporations as partners.  

> **Explanation:** Partnerships are pass-through entities and file an information return (Form 1065). The partnership’s income, losses, credits, and deductions flow through to the partners, reported on Schedule K-1.

### Which entity type typically has no limitation on ownership but faces the potential for double taxation?  
- [x] C Corporation  
- [ ] S Corporation  
- [ ] Limited Partnership  
- [ ] Single-Member LLC  

> **Explanation:** C corporations have no ownership limitations, but face the classic double taxation scenario: corporate income tax and shareholder-level tax on dividends.

### An S Corporation must fulfill which of the following requirements?  
- [x] Have only one class of stock, with some allowance for voting differences.  
- [ ] Have both common and preferred stock.  
- [ ] Permit foreign corporation shareholders.  
- [ ] Allow more than 100 shareholders with no residency constraints.  

> **Explanation:** S corporations are limited to one class of stock (though voting vs. nonvoting is permissible). They cannot have more than 100 shareholders, and shareholders must generally be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.

### A Limited Liability Company (LLC) by default is taxed as:  
- [x] A partnership if it has two or more members, and a disregarded entity if it has one member.  
- [ ] A C corporation unless it files Form 2553.  
- [ ] A sole proprietorship in all cases.  
- [ ] An S corporation in all cases.  

> **Explanation:** An LLC with multiple members is treated as a partnership by default, and a single-member LLC is treated as a disregarded entity for tax purposes unless it elects otherwise.

### In a general partnership, partners typically face which of the following concerning liability?  
- [x] Unlimited personal liability for partnership debts and obligations.  
- [ ] Liability is limited to the value of their partnership interest.  
- [ ] Liability is limited to capital contributions, similar to corporate shareholders.  
- [ ] Liability is shared with the corporation’s other general partners.  

> **Explanation:** General partners have unlimited personal liability for partnership debts. This can be mitigated through limited partnerships (LPs), limited liability partnerships (LLPs), or converting to an LLC structure.

### Which entity usually raises concerns around “built-in gains tax”?  
- [x] S Corporations converting from C Corporation status.  
- [ ] LLCs filing as disregarded entities.  
- [ ] Limited Partnerships switching to LLPs.  
- [ ] C Corporations registering in multiple states.  

> **Explanation:** Built-in gains (BIG) tax rules apply specifically to S Corporations that have converted from C Corporation status. The BIG tax is designed to capture corporate-level tax on appreciated assets held at the time of conversion if sold within a built-in gains recognition period.

### True or False: An S corporation can have corporate or partnership shareholders as long as they are based in the United States.  
- [x] False  
- [ ] True  

> **Explanation:** S corporations cannot have corporate or partnership shareholders, regardless of location. Only certain trusts, estates, and individuals (who are U.S. citizens or resident aliens) are permitted.
