## 22.4 Estate & Gift Integration with Corporate Ownership

Estate and gift planning frequently intersects with corporate structures, especially when business owners or family members hold equity in closely held corporations, S corporations, partnerships, or even publicly traded entities. By carefully coordinating lifetime gifting programs and testamentary transfers (through wills or trusts), taxpayers can significantly mitigate federal transfer taxes, ensure smooth family business succession, and potentially leverage favorable provisions such as the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exclusion. This section explores the critical considerations and mechanics behind estate and gift integration with corporate ownership, building on concepts from earlier chapters such as Chapter 6 (Transfers During Life – Gift Taxation & Strategy), Chapter 7 (Personal Financial Planning), Chapter 12 (Trusts & Tax-Exempt Organizations), and Chapter 13.4 (Planning Around Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) Exclusions).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### Introduction and Overview

When an individual—or a family—owns shares in a corporation, the transfer of those shares by gift or upon death can trigger unique planning concerns. Federal and state gift, estate, and generation-skipping taxes (GST) interplay with corporate law, shareholder agreements, and potential valuation discounts. Additionally, with large fortunes often tied up in business interests, designing an integrated estate and gift strategy becomes essential to protect wealth, minimize taxes, and preserve the business for future generations.

Key considerations include:

• Valuation of Transferred Shares: The corporation’s fair market value (FMV) forms the basis for determining gift or estate tax exposure.  
• Lifetime vs. Testamentary Transfers: Differences in step-up in basis, application of estate taxes, and possible leveraging of annual or lifetime exclusions.  
• Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) Benefits: Exemptions under IRC §1202 upon sale of QSBS may provide significant tax savings during the holder’s life and for successors.  
• Trust Structures: Irrevocable or grantor trusts may help to centralize ownership, ensure continuity, and harness valuation discounts.  
• Business Succession: Coordinating buy-sell agreements, shareholder restrictions, or redemption strategies becomes vital to prevent disputes.  

In this section, we will distill these points into a cohesive roadmap for estate and gift integration with corporate ownership, illustrating how to layer advanced tax strategies to achieve optimal outcomes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 1. Valuation Methodologies and Discounts

Valuation is the bedrock of estate and gift tax computations. The value of a transferred interest in a corporation establishes the amount of gift or estate tax due. Generally, IRC §§2031 (estate tax) and 2512 (gift tax) hinge on fair market value—the price at which a willing buyer and seller, neither under compulsion nor with special knowledge, would conclude a transaction.

#### 1.1 Fair Market Value Approaches
Common approaches to valuing a corporation for estate and gift tax purposes include:

• Income Approach: Discounted cash flow or capitalization of earnings.  
• Market Approach: Comparison to similar publicly traded companies or completed transactions in the same industry.  
• Asset-Based Approach: Valuing the underlying assets, then adjusting for liabilities and intangible goodwill.

#### 1.2 Minority and Marketability Discounts
Taxpayers often seek valuation discounts to reduce the apparent value of transferred interests:

• Minority Interest Discount: Reflects lack of control inherent in non-controlling partial ownership blocks (e.g., 10% or 30% of the corporation).  
• Lack of Marketability Discount: Reflects reduced liquidity if the shares are not freely tradable (common in family-owned businesses).  

These discounts can significantly reduce the total gift or estate tax burden, especially when transferring minority interests. Chapter 6 (Transfers During Life – Gift Taxation & Strategy) provides background on how to properly document and defend valuation discounts. However, the IRS closely scrutinizes such discounts, so competent valuations and appraisals are essential.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 2. Lifetime Gifting of Corporate Shares

Conveying corporate shares during one’s lifetime can be an effective estate planning technique, especially if the shares are expected to appreciate in value substantially. By transferring equity now, gift tax is assessed on the current fair market value rather than a potentially higher future value.

#### 2.1 Annual Exclusion and Unified Credit

• Annual Gift Tax Exclusion: Donors can gift up to a specified annual amount (indexed for inflation; see Chapter 6.1) to any number of recipients without incurring gift tax or utilizing the unified credit.  
• Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption: The lifetime exemption (unified credit) shields gifts up to a certain total threshold (combined with the basic estate tax exclusion). Any gifts exceeding the annual exclusion reduce the donor’s remaining lifetime exemption.

#### 2.2 Strategies to Optimize Gifting Shares
An effective gifting approach can lower the donor’s future estate tax liability by removing appreciating assets from the taxable estate:

1. **Fractionalizing Ownership**: Instead of gifting 100% of corporate shares outright, donors often strategically create multiple minority blocks, potentially increasing minority and lack of marketability discounts.  
2. **Using Trusts**: An irrevocable trust can serve as the recipient of shares. This trust can be structured to keep appreciation outside the donor’s estate and provide creditor protection for beneficiaries.  
3. **Pre- or Post-Gift Redemption Agreements**: The corporation may redeem a portion of gifted shares (if permissible by law and corporate bylaws), thereby effecting ownership transitions without triggering immediate realized gains.  
4. **Spousal Planning**: Spouses benefit from the unlimited marital deduction, allowing transfers between them free of gift or estate tax. This can open up advanced strategies such as “spousal lifetime access trusts (SLATs)” that combine gifting of shares with spousal lifetime benefits.

#### 2.3 Practical Example – Generation Transfer of Family Corporation
Consider a family-owned enterprise with a fair market value (FMV) of $10 million. The patriarch holds 80% of the voting shares and wants to transfer 30% to his adult children. This 30% block, if minority, might attract a combined discount of 25%. If the undiscounted block is worth $3 million (30% × $10 million), the discounted gift might be appraised at just $2.25 million, significantly reducing the taxable gift. Over time, the children receive the growth and future appreciation, substantially offloading future estate tax exposure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 3. Trust Ownership of Corporate Shares

Trust structures can facilitate the intergenerational transfer of corporate ownership in a controlled manner. Irrevocable trusts in particular can protect and preserve assets from being included in the grantor’s estate. Chapter 12 (Trusts & Tax-Exempt Organizations) offers detailed trust fundamentals.

#### 3.1 Types of Trusts Commonly Used
• **Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)**: Although primarily focused on holding life insurance policies, an ILIT can also own corporate shares for estate liquidity purposes.  
• **Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)**: As introduced in Chapter 6.3, a GRAT can receive corporate shares; future appreciation above the IRS hurdle rate transfers to intended beneficiaries gift-tax free.  
• **Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT)**: Grantor’s spouse can potentially benefit from trust income or principal, while corporate shares grow outside the donor’s estate.  
• **Dynasty Trust**: A multigenerational structure to keep assets out of the estates of multiple generations, enabling prolonged tax deferral.

#### 3.2 Trustee Responsibilities and Shareholder Rights
The trustee must exercise fiduciary obligations in accordance with the trust document. This means voting rights for corporate shares may lie solely with the trustee, or they may be directed by or even reserved to particular individuals, depending on the trust’s design. Close alignment of trust provisions with corporate governance ensures smooth administration.

### 3.3 Diagram – Corporate Shares Held in an Irrevocable Trust

Below is a simple diagram illustrating how a trust can hold corporate shares:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Grantor/Shareholder] -->|Transfer Shares| B((Irrevocable Trust))
    B -->|Owns| C[Closely Held Corporation]
    C -->|Future Growth| D[Trust Beneficiaries]
```

• The Grantor transfers shares into the irrevocable trust.  
• The trust becomes a shareholder of the closely held corporation.  
• Beneficiaries benefit from the corporation’s growth and distributions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 4. Estate Tax Considerations upon Death

Upon a shareholder’s death, any corporate shares owned directly by the decedent are typically included in the estate under IRC §2031. For closely held corporations, it is crucial to address:

1. **Fair Market Value**: Determined as of either the date of death or the alternate valuation date (six months later, if elected and if it lowers the overall estate value).  
2. **Step-Up (or Step-Down) in Basis**: Beneficiaries often receive a step-up in basis equal to the date-of-death FMV—highly advantageous for subsequent dispositions (see Chapter 19 for more on basis adjustments).  
3. **Ensuring Liquidity**: Funding estate taxes can be challenging if the deceased’s estate includes mostly illiquid corporate stock. Strategies include buy-sell agreements (Chapter 19.1 explores related-party sales), life insurance funding, or redemption by the corporation under §303 (if applicable).

If the decedent-owned shares remain heavily discounted, the total estate tax burden might be reduced, but the step-up in basis for the heirs is also correspondingly lower. Balancing the interplay of discounts, estate inclusion, and basis adjustments is a key part of integrated planning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 5. Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) Considerations

Chapter 13.4 covers planning around QSBS (IRC §1202), which provides for partial or total exclusion of capital gains upon the sale of qualified small business stock if certain requirements are met (e.g., original issuance, five-year holding period, active business requirements).

#### 5.1 Gifting QSBS
If an individual holds QSBS and gifts shares during lifetime, the donee generally “tacks” the donor’s holding period. This means the donee can potentially benefit from the IRC §1202 gain exclusion if the combined holding period meets the five-year threshold. However, the annual gift tax exclusion and lifetime exclusion apply to the market value of the shares at the time of transfer.

#### 5.2 QSBS and Estate Planning
Upon death, the decedent’s estate obtains a stepped-up basis for income tax purposes, but this does not reset the five-year QSBS clock for the heirs. Instead, the heirs continue the decedent’s holding period (tacking continues). Provided the original issuance, active trade or business requirements, and total QSBS limitations remain intact, we can integrate QSBS with testamentary planning for potential capital gains tax relief.

#### 5.3 Example – Combining QSBS with GRAT
1. An entrepreneur founds a tech start-up qualifying for QSBS status.  
2. She transfers shares to a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust when their value is relatively low.  
3. If the company’s value soars, the appreciation is effectively transferred to the trust beneficiaries.  
4. Upon sale after the five-year holding period, any recognized gain may qualify for the QSBS exclusion.  

This synergy can create a powerful wealth transfer tool, reducing or eliminating both estate and capital gains taxes on future appreciation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 6. Coordinate with Corporate Governance and Buy-Sell Agreements

Corporate governance documents, including bylaws and shareholder agreements, often restrict share transfers. Family businesses may have buy-sell arrangements providing that shareholders can only transfer shares to certain permitted transferees or that the corporation has a right of first refusal. Ensuring compliance with these agreements is crucial for estate and gift planning:

• **Right of First Refusal**: A corporation or other shareholders may have the right to purchase the transferred shares at a specified price—which might conflict with the intended gift to successors.  
• **Mandatory Redemption Trigger**: Some agreements require a redemption upon the owner’s death, which could hamper desired estate planning or trust structures.  
• **Valuation Provision**: An internal buy-sell agreement might set a price for share transfers, impacting potential valuation discounts or the fair market value for gift tax reporting.  

Careful alignment of gift or estate strategies with corporate governance helps ensure that all parties’ interests are protected and that the IRS cannot argue for a different value or rewrite the transaction’s terms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 7. Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Tax Aspects

For families wishing to pass wealth to grandchildren or more remote descendants, the GST tax represents another layer of complexity. Estate and gift integration extends to how corporate shares might be transferred across multiple generations:

• **Direct Skip**: A gift directly to a skip person (e.g., grandchild).  
• **Taxable Termination**: Trust distributions to skip persons following a non-skip person’s death.  
• **Allocation of GST Exemption**: Just as one allocates gift or estate tax exemption, the GST exemption (indexed annually) is allocated to transfers that would otherwise generate GST tax.

ER in mind that if a trust is structured as a generation-skipping vehicle, the portion of the trust that remains exempt from GST taxes can hold appreciating corporate shares indefinitely, removing them from future estates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 8. Handling Complexities with S Corporations

Gift and estate transfers involving S corporation stock demand special considerations to ensure the entity retains its S election (Chapter 10 contains a detailed discussion of S corporation fundamentals):

1. **Permissible Shareholders**: All shareholders of an S corporation must be individuals, certain types of trusts (e.g., QSSTs, ESBTs), or estates. Ineligible shareholders trigger involuntary termination of S status.  
2. **Trust Classification**: An irrevocable trust receiving S corporation stock must elect to be treated as a QSST or ESBT within a specific period.  
3. **Coordination with Estate Administration**: Upon a shareholder’s death, the estate can hold S corporation shares temporarily without jeopardizing the election. However, timely actions are required to avoid reclassification.

Failure to comply with these rules can inadvertently convert the S corporation to a C corporation, creating negative tax consequences for the owners.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 9. Special Case: Family Limited Partnerships and LLCs

Though this chapter focuses on corporate ownership, many families accomplish similar estate and gift objectives via partnerships (Chapter 11 covers Partnerships & LLCs) or limited liability companies. The same principles apply: the valuation discounts (minority, lack of marketability), gifting program, QSBS benefits (if applicable, typically in a corporate setting), trust ownership, and estate inclusion. Coordination with operating agreements or partnership agreements is similarly critical.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 10. Coordinating Lifetime Gifts, Estate Devices, and Corporate Ownership: A Step-by-Step Strategy

Below is a structured approach that integrates multiple aspects:

1. **Preliminary Analysis**  
   – Gather corporate documents and confirm share restrictions.  
   – Assess whether the shares qualify for QSBS status.  
   – Estimate potential valuation discounts.  

2. **Establish or Update Estate Plan**  
   – Draft or revise wills and trusts (e.g., revocable living trust, irrevocable trusts, testamentary trusts).  
   – Consider philanthropic or charitable giving components, if desired.  

3. **Select the Appropriate Vehicles for Lifetime Gifts**  
   – Explore partial gift transfers of corporate shares dispersed over multiple years.  
   – Choose or create specialized trusts (GRAT, SLAT, QSST, ESBT).  

4. **File Required Tax Elections and Returns**  
   – Gift tax returns (Form 709) to report any non-excludable gifts.  
   – S corporation trust elections or disclaimers if necessary.  
   – Valuations and appraisals to support discount claims and ensure compliance.  

5. **Monitor Business Growth & Adjust Strategy**  
   – As the corporation’s value changes, periodically reevaluate gift transfers, trust funding, and distribution strategies.  
   – Maintain compliance with buy-sell agreements or other corporate governance documents.  

6. **Coordinate with Final Estate Administration**  
   – Ensure basis step-up is fully leveraged where beneficial.  
   – Redeem shares from the estate if helpful in funding estate taxes.  
   – Transfer shares seamlessly to heirs or trusts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 11. Practical Case Study

#### Objective
A second-generation family wants to ensure that ownership and control of the corporation pass smoothly to third-generation members while reducing overall transfer tax exposure. The corporation’s shares may qualify for QSBS treatment. The family also wants to leverage minority and marketability discounts.

#### Initial Setup
• The father (Founder) currently holds 70% of the closely held stock, with a fair market value of $7 million.  
• Two adult children each hold 10%, and a family trust holds the remaining 10%.  
• The father qualifies for the QSBS exclusion, having held the shares since the corporation’s founding.  

#### Planning Steps

1. **GRAT Implementation**  
   – The father transfers a portion of his 70% interest (e.g., 20%) into a two-year GRAT.  
   – If the business value grows beyond the IRS 7520 rate, the excess growth passes to the children at the end of the GRAT term tax-free.

2. **Annual Exclusion Gifts**  
   – Over several years, the father also gifts small blocks of shares (within the annual gift tax exclusion limit) to various family members to diversify ownership further.  

3. **Irrevocable Trust for Grandchildren**  
   – The father simultaneously creates an irrevocable dynasty trust for the grandchildren, transferring a minority block of corporate shares.  
   – Because this block is only 5%, a combined minority and lack of marketability discount reduces the gift’s reported value, mitigating gift tax.  
   – The trust makes a QSST election if needed to maintain S corporation status (if the corporation is S, or if it elects S at a future date).

4. **Buy-Sell Agreement Refinement**  
   – The buy-sell agreement is updated to allow these trust transfers to maintain compliance.  
   – Stipulations ensure the father’s estate can redeem a limited portion of shares if necessary to cover final estate taxes.  

5. **Overlapping QSBS Status**  
   – By the time shares are sold (if that occurs after five years), any gain recognized by family members or the trust can qualify for up to 100% exclusion under §1202, subject to the rules and limitations.  

#### Result
Through a coordinated gift and estate plan, the father dilutes his ownership interest—locking in minority discounts—while preserving significant QSBS benefits. The grandchildren’s trust accumulates shares outside both the father’s estate and potentially the children’s estates, thereby achieving multiple generations of transfer tax savings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 12. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

• **Misalignment with Corporate Agreements**: Failing to align trustee powers and distribution provisions with buy-sell or shareholder agreements can jeopardize the overall planning structure.  
• **Improper Valuations**: Understating or overstating share value can lead to IRS challenges, penalties, and extended audits. Work with qualified appraisers.  
• **Neglecting the S Corporation Rules**: Inadvertent S election terminations can trigger adverse tax consequences.  
• **Insufficient Liquidity for Estate Taxes**: Even with discounts, estate taxes might be substantial. Evaluating life insurance policies, partial redemptions under §303, or cross-purchase agreements are essential.  
• **Overlooking GST Treatment**: Transferring shares to grandchildren’s trusts without allocating GST exemption can cause future surprises.  
• **Missing Deadlines**: Elections for QSST, ESBT, or disclaimers must be timely. Late or missed filings can undo carefully laid plans.

#### Best Practices
– Obtain thorough legal and tax advice throughout each step.  
– Ensure clarity in trust documents regarding voting rights and distributions.  
– Regularly review the plan as laws, regulations, and business circumstances change.  
– Document every transfer meticulously, including updated valuations, to firmly support the desired tax treatment if audited.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### 13. Charts and Visual Aids

Below is a simplified chart showing potential flow of equity when using multiple entities and trusts:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Founder/Shareholder (70%)] --> B((GRAT))
    A --> C((Irrevocable Dynasty Trust))
    A --> D[Children (10% each)]
    B --> E[Closely Held Corporation]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    E --> F[[Business Growth & Distributions]]
    F --> B
    F --> C
    F --> D
```

• Founder transfers blocks of shares to a GRAT, an irrevocable dynasty trust, and directly to children over time.  
• Each entity or individual becomes a partial owner of the closely held corporation.  
• As the business grows, distributions or eventual sale proceeds flow back to each owner proportionally.

### Conclusion

Integrating estate and gift planning with corporate ownership is both an art and a science, requiring meticulous coordination of valuations, trust structures, buy-sell agreements, and federal tax rules. By combining lifetime gifting strategies (e.g., GRATs, annual exclusions, QSBS transfers) with post-mortem planning tools (e.g., testamentary trusts, basis step-ups, redemption provisions), families can preserve corporate value, minimize transfer taxation, and ensure a seamless transition of ownership across generations.

Key takeaways include:

• Leverage discounts to counterbalance the corporation’s FMV.  
• Use trusts to manage and protect ownership interests while facilitating intergenerational transfers.  
• Recognize the powerful potential of QSBS for capital gains exclusion.  
• Stay vigilant about S corporation and GST tax obligations.  
• Consistently review and update the estate plan, especially if the corporation or tax laws evolve.

Taken together, these strategies provide a framework for business owners and individuals seeking to integrate tax-efficient estate and gift strategies with corporate ownership—ultimately leading to more secure, tax-beneficial transitions for branches of the same family or multiple generations.

## Comprehensive Estate & Gift Integration with Corporate Ownership Quiz

{{< quizdown >}}

### Which discount primarily reflects the difficulty or inability to sell shares in a private company?

- [ ] Minority discount
- [x] Lack of marketability discount
- [ ] Blockage discount
- [ ] Control premium

> **Explanation:** Lack of marketability discount is applied when shares are illiquid or not readily tradable, reflecting the challenges in quickly finding a buyer at full fair market value.


### What is a key advantage of lifetime gifting for shares expected to appreciate substantially?

- [ ] It avoids annual gift tax filing requirements.
- [x] It removes future appreciation from the donor’s estate.
- [ ] It guarantees no income tax on dividends.
- [ ] It eliminates all estate taxes for the donor.

> **Explanation:** Transferring shares during the donor’s lifetime shifts subsequent growth and potential appreciation out of the donor’s estate, potentially reducing future estate tax liabilities.


### When an S corporation stock is transferred to a trust, what is critical to maintaining the corporation’s S election?

- [x] The trust must qualify as a permissible S corporation shareholder.
- [ ] Appointing a corporate trustee is mandatory.
- [ ] Filing a gift tax return is not required if you use the annual exclusion.
- [ ] The IRS must grant a private letter ruling after each transfer.

> **Explanation:** An S corporation can only have eligible shareholders (e.g., individuals, certain trusts like QSSTs or ESBTs). If the trust does not meet these criteria or fails to file the right election on time, S status is terminated.


### If shares of corporate stock are included in a decedent’s taxable estate, what generally happens to the beneficiaries’ basis in those shares?

- [x] The beneficiaries receive a step-up (or step-down) in basis to fair market value at the date of death.
- [ ] The beneficiaries must use the decedent’s original cost basis.
- [ ] The beneficiaries’ basis is determined by the corporation’s earnings and profits.
- [ ] The beneficiaries are not allowed to change the basis of inherited shares.

> **Explanation:** Pursuant to IRC §1014, inherited assets typically receive a step-up (or step-down) to fair market value as of the decedent’s date of death (or alternate valuation date).


### Which reason best explains why corporate governance documents (e.g., buy-sell agreements) must be examined during estate and gift transfers?

- [x] They may restrict or condition the transfer of shares, affecting valuation and ownership rights.
- [ ] They always require immediate payment of estate taxes at the corporate level.
- [x] They never allow any valuation discounts for minority ownership.
- [ ] They convert S corporations to C corporations upon shareholder death.

> **Explanation:** Buy-sell agreements can impose transfer restrictions, rights of first refusal, or mandatory redemption provisions that significantly impact how shares are valued and transferred among shareholders and heirs.


### If a donor transfers Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) to a donee, what happens to the holding period for §1202 eligibility?

- [x] The donee generally tacks on the donor’s holding period.
- [ ] The donee must restart the holding period from zero.
- [ ] The donee must hold the stock for three years to secure the original holding period.
- [ ] The donor loses any accumulated holding period for QSBS.

> **Explanation:** QSBS rules allow the donee to add the donor’s holding period to their own, preserving eligibility for potential §1202 gain exclusion if total holding meets or exceeds five years.


### Which statement is true regarding estate inclusion of corporate shares at death?

- [x] The shares’ fair market value is included, potentially subject to estate tax.
- [ ] Shares in a family corporation are automatically excluded from estate tax.
- [ ] No estate tax applies if shares were transferred to an irrevocable trust within one year of death.
- [ ] The alternate valuation date is available only for publicly traded shares.

> **Explanation:** Corporate shares owned at death must be included in the decedent’s estate at fair market value, except to the extent of any prior valid transfers. The alternate valuation date is available to reduce estate tax if it lowers the estate’s overall valuation.


### Why might a family embed multiple donors gifting small blocks of shares over several years?

- [x] To leverage annual exclusions and build minority blocks for valuation discounts.
- [ ] To eliminate the need for future gift tax returns.
- [ ] To convert ordinary income into tax-free interest.
- [ ] To comply automatically with S corporation rules.

> **Explanation:** By distributing shares across family members’ annual gift exclusions and using minority blocks, families can optimize discounts, reduce immediate tax liabilities, and break up large ownership concentrations.


### Which entity structure is most scrutinized regarding permissible owners under S corporation rules?

- [x] Trusts
- [ ] C corporations
- [ ] Front-end LLCs
- [ ] Public charities

> **Explanation:** S corporations have strict limitations on ownership; certain trusts (e.g., QSSTs, ESBTs) qualify, but other entities may not, leading to heightened scrutiny.


### A best practice in estate and gift integration with corporate ownership is to:

- [x] Periodically review and update valuations and trust documents as laws and business conditions change.
- [ ] Rely solely on verbal agreements with family members to solidify ownership transfers.
- [ ] Avoid buy-sell agreements because they complicate valuations.
- [ ] Keep estate planning unrelated to the corporation’s governance policies.

> **Explanation:** Laws, regulations, and a company’s value can evolve—hence, frequent reviews and updates to trust documents, valuations, and corporate agreements are vital to ensure ongoing compliance and optimal tax planning.
