## 21.1 Examination by IRS: Statute of Limitations, Appeals & Court System

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has broad powers to examine or audit tax returns in order to ensure compliance with federal tax laws. Understanding the respective statutes of limitations, appeal processes, and available court systems is paramount for Certified Public Accountant (CPA) candidates preparing for the Tax Compliance and Planning (TCP) section. In practice, a well-founded knowledge of these procedures not only allows a CPA to represent clients effectively in examinations, but it also informs strategic tax planning and risk assessment.  

This section will explore the timeframes applicable to tax examinations, highlight the legal framework behind the three-year and six-year rules, delve into special exceptions that may extend or shorten the window for assessment, and discuss the formal administrative appeals process. We will then conclude with an overview of how taxpayers may contest IRS findings in U.S. courts.  

Use this information in conjunction with Chapter 21’s broader “Practice & Procedure” coverage. For a deeper exploration of penalties and compliance triggers, see Section 21.2.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### The Role of the Statute of Limitations

A statute of limitations provides a deadline by which the IRS can assess additional taxes or initiate further examination. Once this period expires, the IRS is barred from assessing additional liability (barring specific exceptions). Conversely, taxpayers also have deadlines for filing refund claims or making certain adjustments.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### General Three-Year Rule

Under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) §6501(a), the IRS typically has three years from the date a return is filed to assess any additional tax, including penalties and interest. This three-year clock usually begins on the later of:  
• The original due date of the return (usually April 15, or the next business day if that date falls on a weekend or holiday).  
• The actual date the return is filed, if filed after the due date (including extensions).  

For example, if a taxpayer submits a timely 2024 calendar-year individual return on April 15, 2025, the IRS generally has until April 15, 2028, to propose changes or assess additional tax. The date you file the return can be critical, especially in situations involving amended returns, late filings, or extended returns (e.g., using Form 4868 for individuals).  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### Six-Year Rule for Substantial Omissions

The IRC extends the standard three-year limit to six years if the taxpayer has substantially understated gross income. The threshold triggering a six-year statute is usually when a taxpayer omits more than 25% of the gross income stated on the return (IRC §6501(e)). For example, if a taxpayer reported $400,000 of gross income on a Schedule C but actually earned $540,000 from that sole proprietorship, the omission exceeds 25% of the reported amount, thereby triggering the extended six-year period.  

Additionally, the same concept applies if the taxpayer unintentionally omits certain types of items subject to special reporting, such as certain foreign income or foreign transactions. Practitioners and CPA exam candidates should be aware that the 25% rule exists to balance the interest in allowing the IRS time to detect and correct larger or more complex omissions.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### Other Exceptions and Extensions

While the three- and six-year rules are the most frequently encountered, IRS statutes of limitations may be extended or overridden under certain circumstances, including:  

• Fraudulent Returns: If the IRS suspects fraud, such as underreporting income with intent to evade tax, there is no statute of limitations. The IRS can assess taxes and penalties at any time.  
• Failure to File: If a taxpayer fails to file a return at all, there is no limitation period. Again, the IRS may initiate examination and assessment indefinitely.  
• Adjustments to Net Operating Loss Carryforwards or Credits: If the tax year under examination includes carryover items derived from earlier years, the IRS may examine those earlier years’ returns to determine the correct amount of the carryover, even if the normal statute of limitations on those earlier years has expired.  
• Consents to Extend the Statute of Limitations: Taxpayers may voluntarily extend the period (commonly Form 872, Consent to Extend the Time to Assess Tax) if they want additional time to provide documentation or reach a resolution without forcing an immediate assessment.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### When the Clock Begins Running

An important point of focus for CPA candidates is precisely when the clock on the statute of limitations starts. Generally, it starts on the later of the due date or the date the return was actually filed. If a taxpayer files early, the statute typically starts running on the initial due date. If a taxpayer files after an extension, the statute starts on the filing date.  

While self-assessment simplifies the process for most taxpayers, an amended return can also affect certain aspects of the assessment period. In many cases, filing an amended return does not automatically extend the three-year limitation unless the additional tax results from issues not previously addressed on the original return.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### Overview of the IRS Examination Process

The examination, also called an audit, is the primary way the IRS identifies discrepancies, verifies reported information, and ensures compliance. There are several ways an audit might begin:  
• IRS computer scoring systems (DIF scores, or Discriminant Function System) detecting anomalies.  
• Compliance checks on returns with certain types of transactions, such as large charitable deductions or complicated partnership structures (see Chapter 11 for partnership complexities).  
• Random selection for the National Research Program.  

Audits can take place via correspondence, in-office appointments at an IRS facility, or in-field investigations at a taxpayer’s home or place of business.  

#### Typical Examination Timeline

1. Initial Notification: The taxpayer receives a letter (often CP2000 for mismatch notices or a statutory notice) with instructions.  
2. Information Gathering: The IRS requests documentation (e.g., bank statements, receipts).  
3. Findings: The IRS agent will propose adjustments if they find a discrepancy.  
4. Response or Protest: The taxpayer may agree or disagree and choose to appeal as needed.  

Below is a conceptual illustration of the examination flow, from the taxpayer receiving an initial notice to an ultimate settlement, which may occur administratively or through court proceedings.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A([Return Selected\nfor Examination]) --> B([Notification to Taxpayer\n(CP2000/Letter)])
    B --> C([Information &\nDocumentation Request])
    C --> D([IRS Findings\nProposed Adjustments])
    D --> E([30-Day Letter])
    E --> F([Administrative Appeal\n(Negotiation with Appeals) ])
    F --> G([90-Day Letter])
    G --> H([Tax Court])
    G --> I([District Court /\nCourt of Federal Claims])
```

**Explanation of Flow**  
• The process typically begins with the return being flagged or selected (A).  
• The taxpayer is then notified and asked to provide supporting documentation (B and C).  
• Once the IRS examiner completes the review, they will detail any recommended adjustments (D).  
• If the IRS proposes changes, they issue a “30-Day Letter” giving the taxpayer 30 days to appeal or accept.  
• If no resolution is found during the administrative process (F), the IRS sends a “90-Day Letter,” also known as a Statutory Notice of Deficiency. At this stage, the taxpayer can file a petition with the U.S. Tax Court without first paying the disputed tax (H). Otherwise, the taxpayer may pay the tax and file a refund suit in the District Court or the Court of Federal Claims (I).  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### Administrative Appeals

Once the IRS examination team issues a 30-Day Letter (or sometimes a preliminary adjustment), a taxpayer has the right to elevate the dispute to the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS Office of Appeals is an independent body whose mission is to resolve disputes without litigation.  

#### Forms of Protest

To initiate an administrative appeal, the taxpayer generally files a written protest. Two primary forms of protest exist:

1. Informal (Small Case) Protest: For disputes under certain dollar limits (often $25,000 or less), the taxpayer can file a small case request, typically a more simplified letter.  
2. Formal Protest: For larger amounts or more complex situations, a formal, detailed written protest is required. This protest should outline the disputed issues, relevant tax law, factual background, and arguments supporting the taxpayer’s position.  

#### Levels of Review

• Appeals Officer: An Appeals Officer will review the case, discuss the merits of each issue, and often negotiate a settlement.  
• Fast-Track Mediation or Settlement: In some circumstances, the taxpayer may utilize alternative dispute resolution methods, such as Fast-Track Settlement, to expedite resolution.  

Most disputes (and especially those that are well-documented and supported by solid legal arguments) can be resolved at the Appeals level. Such resolution avoids the time and cost of a formal lawsuit.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### The 90-Day Letter and Court Forum Selection

If resolution is not reached at Appeals, or if the taxpayer bypasses Appeals, the IRS will typically issue a Statutory Notice of Deficiency, commonly called the 90-Day Letter. This notice states the assessed deficiency and explains the taxpayer’s right to challenge it in court within 90 days (150 days if the taxpayer is out of the country).  

At this juncture, the taxpayer has two main options:

1. File a Petition with the Tax Court (without paying the disputed liability).  
2. Pay the assessed amount and file a claim for refund in a U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.  

Choosing the right forum depends on several factors, including the desire to avoid paying the tax upfront, court jurisprudence on similar issues, circuit precedent, or simply the preference for a bench trial (e.g., District Court) versus a trial before a specialized tax judiciary (U.S. Tax Court).  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### Overview of U.S. Court Systems for Tax Disputes

When administrative remedies fail or are bypassed, taxpayers can turn to the judicial system. Essentially, there are three main courts that hear federal tax cases:

#### U.S. Tax Court
• Specialized in tax matters.  
• The taxpayer is not required to pay the disputed tax prior to filing suit.  
• Judges are typically experts in tax law.  
• Tax Court decisions might be appealed to the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals based on the taxpayer’s place of residence.  

#### U.S. District Court
• General federal trial court; taxpayer must first pay the disputed tax and then file a claim for a refund.  
• Taxpayers can request a jury trial, which is not available in Tax Court.  

#### U.S. Court of Federal Claims
• Has jurisdiction over various claims against the federal government, including tax refund suits.  
• No jury trials; decisions may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  

Choosing the appropriate court involves strategic considerations: the cost of litigation, the ability to pay the tax first, and prior favorable or unfavorable case precedents in the local federal courts.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### Illustrative Example: A Schedule C Understatement

To show how the statute of limitations and appeals might interact in a realistic scenario, consider Mary, a sole proprietor of a small retail business, who reported $300,000 in gross receipts on her personal (Form 1040) Schedule C. Later, the IRS uncovers third-party bank statements indicating Mary’s actual deposits were $410,000. Here’s a possible sequence of events:

• Since Mary omitted more than 25% of her gross income (an understatement of $110,000), the six-year statute of limitations applies.  
• Four years after the original filing, she receives a notice that the IRS is auditing her return.  
• The auditor proposes an additional tax assessment based on the unreported $110,000. Mary receives a 30-Day Letter with an explanation of proposed changes.  
• Mary requests a formal appeal and provides documentation showing some of the $110,000 was a non-taxable deposit from a family member. She negotiates a partial reduction of the proposed assessment within the IRS Appeals Office.  
• If Mary disagrees with the final Appeals determination, the IRS will issue a 90-Day Letter. She may petition the U.S. Tax Court if she still disputes the liability.  

This case underscores how the standard three-year period can expand to six years in cases of substantial omissions and demonstrates how the administrative appeals process can refine (and sometimes reduce) proposed assessments.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

• Details Matter: Missing documentation or inaccurate recordkeeping often leads to protracted audits. Encourage clients (and remind yourself) to keep meticulous records (7 years is a common benchmark for retention).  
• Extensions Are Negotiable: Sometimes, extending the statute of limitations (Form 872) can be beneficial if more time is necessary to gather evidence, negotiate a settlement, or avoid a forced quick assessment.  
• Respect Deadlines: Failure to respond timely to a 30-Day or 90-Day Letter forfeits important rights, including appeals or Tax Court petition.  
• Avoid Triggering Red Flags: While random audits happen, certain transactions (large charitable contributions, rental losses, cryptocurrency transactions, or multi-state apportionment complexities) tend to get more scrutiny. See Chapter 23 for in-depth discussion on SALT issues.  
• Seek Professional Guidance: Even CPAs benefit from external counsel in complex disputes or those involving potential criminal exposure.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  

### Practical Strategies for the CPA Exam and Real Life

• Familiarize Yourself with Key IRC Provisions: Know IRC §§6501, 6502, 6503, and other code sections that detail how limitations and extensions apply.  
• Practice Drafting Protest Letters: A formal protest should be clear, fact-based, and cite relevant authority. This skill can help you on simulation questions in the TCP exam.  
• Time Management: On the exam and in real life, deadlines play a pivotal role. Reinforce your memory of typical timeframes and quickly identify legal grounds for any exceptions.  
• Explore Settlement Options: Understanding how to negotiate at the Appeals level can be a game-changer for both exam performance and professional practice.  
• Coordinate With Other Subject Areas: Tie these practice and procedure concepts to entity-specific rules (e.g., S corporations in Chapter 10, Partnerships in Chapter 11) and property transactions in Part V.
