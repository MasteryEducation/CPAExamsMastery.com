## 12.2 Fiduciary Accounting Income & Distributable Net Income

Fiduciary accounting, particularly in the context of trusts, has unique rules and considerations that distinguish it from corporate or individual tax accounting. These distinctions play a critical role in determining taxable distributions and handling principal vs. income allocations. In this section, we explore fiduciary accounting income (FAI) and its relationship to Distributable Net Income (DNI). We also walk through a line-by-line method to calculate DNI and highlight key principles of trustee authority over principal and income.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview and Key Definitions

Trusts are legal instruments that hold property for the benefit of certain individuals or charities. While no two trusts are exactly alike, many follow common frameworks established by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), Treasury regulations, and state laws (including the Uniform Principal and Income Act, or “UPIA,” adopted by most states with some variations).

1. Fiduciary Accounting Income (FAI):  
   • Defined by the trust instrument and applicable state law.  
   • Focuses on how receipts and disbursements are allocated between income and principal from an accounting perspective.  
   • Does not necessarily match taxable income for federal income tax purposes.

2. Distributable Net Income (DNI):  
   • A tax concept used to limit the deduction for income distributions made to beneficiaries and to cap the amount of income that beneficiaries must include on their own returns.  
   • Derived from taxable income of the trust with various adjustments—most notably the exclusion of capital gains typically allocated to principal, and inclusion of certain tax-exempt income.  
   • Ensures only current income is taxed to beneficiaries; income retained by the trust remains subject to trust-level taxation.

Understanding both FAI and DNI is essential for proper trust administration and is tested on the CPA Exam’s Tax Compliance & Planning (TCP) section. Building on Chapter 12.1 (Simple vs. Complex Trusts, Grantor Trust Rules), we now dig deeper into how trustees handle principal vs. income and how practitioners compute DNI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Trustee Authority over Principal vs. Income

### Role of the Trustee
A trustee is the individual or entity entrusted to manage the trust’s assets in accordance with the trust document and relevant laws. Key fiduciary duties include loyalty to the beneficiaries, prudent investment, impartiality among beneficiaries, and accurate accounting of transactions.

• Principal (or Corpus): The original assets transferred to the trust and subsequent capital additions or receipts not classified as income.  
• Income: Cash dividends, interest, royalties, and rent typically constitute income, unless the trust instrument or governing state law directs otherwise.

### Trustee Powers
A trust agreement usually details the trustee’s power to allocate receipts and outlays between principal and income. Where the document is silent, state statutes, such as the Uniform Principal and Income Act, guide the trustee. These decisions affect:

• Beneficiary entitlements: Some beneficiaries may receive current income, whereas others receive principal after a certain term or event.  
• Tax implications: Classification of expenses against principal vs. income can shift taxable income among trust beneficiaries and the trust itself.

### Common Pitfalls
Trustees may inadvertently misallocate receipts—e.g., treating certain capital gains as FAI or incorrectly classifying intangible drilling costs as income expenditures. This can result in:

• Incorrect distributions or inaccurate taxable income allocations.  
• Potential breach of fiduciary duty.  
• Unnecessary tax liabilities or missed deductions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fiduciary Accounting Income (FAI) in Practice

FAI is an accounting concept that measures the trust’s income available for distribution under state law or the trust instrument. Typically, items treated as FAI include:

• Ordinary income items: Interest, dividends, net rental income.  
• Certain expenses charged to income: Management fees, property taxes, insurance attributable to the income portion.  
• Special allocations based on the trust instrument: For instance, the instrument might dictate that 70% of dividends be allocated to income, with the remainder to principal.

By contrast, capital gains and capital losses are generally allocated to principal, although the trust instrument or relevant laws might allow (or require) the trustee to allocate certain categories of gains to income.

### Example: Allocations under Uniform Principal and Income Act  
Suppose a trust receives a $10,000 stock dividend from a portfolio. Under typical state adoption of the UPIA, stock splits and stock dividends are added to principal rather than being paid out as income to the current income beneficiary. The trustee must ensure compliance with both the state’s statutory laws and the trust document’s provisions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Distributable Net Income (DNI): The Tax Driver

While FAI is the accounting measure for trustee distributions, DNI determines how distributions are taxed to beneficiaries and sets the maximum deduction for the trust. DNI ensures that beneficiaries pay tax on their share of trust income (instead of the trust) to the extent distributions are made.

### Core Components of DNI

1. Taxable income of the trust (IRC §641 – §643).  
2. Adjustments for capital gains often allocated to principal. Capital gains retained in the trust typically do not flow to beneficiaries as part of DNI, unless the trust document or state law treats them as income.  
3. Add-back of tax-exempt interest (net of related expenses). While tax-exempt interest is not taxed, it is included in DNI so beneficiaries are not misled regarding total income distributions.  
4. Other adjustments required by §643, including removing the personal exemption for the trust itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Line-by-Line Calculation of DNI

Following is a structured approach to computing DNI, step by step. For clarity, we will use a hypothetical trust example:

• The ABC Trust is a complex trust (discussed in Chapter 12.1), allowed to accumulate income or make discretionary distributions.  
• It has $40,000 of ordinary income (interest and dividends), $5,000 of capital gains, $2,000 of tax-exempt interest income, and $6,000 of expenses allocated to income.  
• Trust instrument states capital gains are allocated to principal, consistent with the Uniform Principal and Income Act in its state.  
• Expenses related to tax-exempt interest are 5% of overall expenses (i.e., $300).

### Example Table: DNI Calculation

Below is a simplified table showing a “start with taxable income, then adjust” approach. Note that each line references commonly encountered items in trust taxation.

| Step | Description                                                            | Amount   |
|-----:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------:|
|  A.  | Taxable income before distribution deduction                          | $34,000  |
|      | ¹ Calculation: ($40,000 ordinary income - $6,000 expenses)            |          |
|  B.  | Subtract capital gains allocated to principal                         |  $(5,000)|
|      | ² The trust retains capital gains in principal.                       |          |
|  C.  | Add back tax-exempt interest                                          |  $2,000  |
|  D.  | Subtract expenses allocable to tax-exempt interest                    |   $(300) |
|      | ³ 5% of $6,000 total expenses relates to exempt interest ($300).      |          |
|  E.  | Adjusted figure (pre-personal exemption)                              | $30,700  |
|  F.  | Ignore trust personal exemption for DNI calculation                   |    N/A   |
|  G.  | Final DNI (Lines A - B + C - D)                                       | $30,700  |

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Start with “Taxable Income Before Distribution Deduction”: The trust’s total income (excluding capital gains if not included in FAI) minus deductible expenses. In our example, $40,000 (interest + dividends) – $6,000 (allocated expenses) = $34,000.  

2. Subtract Capital Gains Allocated to Principal: If gains are not “passed out” to beneficiaries by trust terms or statutory authority, they remain in principal. Therefore, they do not generally enter DNI. We subtract $5,000 of capital gains in this example.  

3. Add Tax-Exempt Interest: Although it is tax-exempt, it must be included in DNI to accurately reflect the income available to beneficiaries. This is $2,000 in our scenario.  

4. Subtract Expenses Allocable to Tax-Exempt Interest: Since $300 of the $6,000 expenses is allocated to earning the tax-exempt interest, we remove that from DNI. The net positive effect of tax-exempt interest is $1,700 ($2,000 – $300).  

5. We do not apply the trust’s personal exemption deduction to DNI calculations. Under IRC §643(a)(2), you “ignore” the trust’s personal exemption for the purpose of determining DNI.  

6. The final DNI is $30,700. That means if this trust distributes $30,700 to beneficiaries, they will be taxed on $30,700, and the trust will receive a distribution deduction for that same amount.  

Notice that capital gains remain in the trust’s principal, so they are generally taxed at the trust level unless the trust instrument or applicable law allocates those gains to income or allows the trustee to do so.

## Understanding FAI vs. DNI with a Flow Diagram

Below is a Mermaid.js flow diagram that demonstrates the difference between Fiduciary Accounting Income (FAI) and Distributable Net Income (DNI). Note the distinct paths that capital gains and certain expenses may take:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A((Total Receipts)) --> B{Allocate Receipts}
    B --> C[Principal <br> (Capital Gains, Corpus)]
    B --> D[Income <br> (Interest, Dividends)]
    D --> E((Fiduciary Accounting Income))

    E --> F{Tax Adjustments}
    F --> G[Remove/Exclude Certain Items <br> (e.g., Gains Allocated to Principal)]
    F --> H[Add <br> Tax-Exempt Income <br> (Net of Expenses)]
    G --> I((DNI))
    H --> I((DNI))
```

Explanations:
• “Total Receipts” includes everything the trust receives during the year.  
• “Allocate Receipts” is the process of classifying items as principal or income.  
• “Fiduciary Accounting Income” is therefore the net result after applying state law or trust rules concerning principal vs. income allocations.  
• “Tax Adjustments” highlight the step from FAI to DNI, incorporating or excluding items according to IRC §§641–643.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The Importance of DNI in Practice

1. Taxable Income Distribution: DNI caps the income inclusion for beneficiaries. If the trust distributes more than DNI, the excess portion is typically a non-taxable distribution of principal.  
2. Avoid Double Taxation: DNI prevents the trust from paying tax on income that it distributes to beneficiaries, as the trust receives a deduction for the distribution and the beneficiaries pick up that income on their returns.  
3. Complex Trust Accumulations: In a complex trust, undistributed DNI is taxed to the trust itself. This often results in higher tax rates since trust tax brackets compress quickly, underscoring the strategic value of distribution planning.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Trustee Authority over Income vs. Principal: Practical Considerations

### Identifying Governing Rules
• Look first to the trust document for instructions on allocation of receipts, disbursements, and capital gains.  
• Consult state statutes, especially if the trust instrument is silent or ambiguous. Many states have adopted the Uniform Principal and Income Act (UPIA), which offers default rules for allocating certain receipts (e.g., mineral royalties, depreciation).  

### Example of Trustee Decision
Assume the ABC Trust’s language provides the trustee “discretion to allocate receipts between income and principal, so long as the allocation is fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries.” If the trust receives a $5,000 litigation settlement that partly compensates for lost income and partly for damage to the trust’s real property, the trustee might justifiably split the settlement into an “income portion” (for lost rent) and a “principal portion” (for property damage), consistent with a fair and reasonable approach.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

1. Failure to Document Allocations: Trustees should keep detailed written records of how they allocated each receipt and expense. Clear documentation wards off beneficiary disputes and demonstrates proper fiduciary diligence in an IRS audit.  
2. Overlooking State-Specific Rules: While the Uniform Principal and Income Act provides a baseline, many states tweak critical provisions. Always confirm the relevant version of the statute for your jurisdiction.  
3. Misallocation of Large Capital Gains: Inadvertently including allocated-to-principal gains in DNI can inflate beneficiary tax liability, creating confusion and possible underpayment or overpayment of taxes.  
4. Communication with Beneficiaries: Provide clear statements on how distributions were determined, explaining differences between FAI and DNI.  
5. Engage Qualified Professionals: Complex or discretionary allocations, especially those involving significant or complicated assets, often require professional input—and the CPA Exam tests your appreciation of when to seek specialized counsel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Real-World Case Study

### Scenario
• The Johnson Family Trust invests in a diverse portfolio generating $50,000 in dividends, $20,000 in interest, and $10,000 in capital gains.  
• The trust also receives $3,000 of tax-exempt municipal bond interest. Of $8,000 total trust expenses, $500 is attributable to tax-exempt income.  
• The trust document provides that capital gains are allocated to principal unless they result from routine turnover of publicly traded stocks, in which case the trustee has discretion to allocate to income in whole or in part.

### Trustee Decision
The trustee decides that the $10,000 in capital gains came from routine short-term stock turnover conducted per the trust’s investment policy. Exercising discretion, the trustee allocates $4,000 to income and $6,000 to principal. This partial allocation approach is consistent with a “fair and reasonable” standard, ensuring that some gains are used to supplement income beneficiaries while preserving a portion for remaindermen.

### Calculating DNI
1) Taxable income before distribution deduction: ($50,000 + $20,000 + $4,000) – $8,000 = $66,000.  
2) Subtract Gains Allocated to Principal: $6,000.  
3) Subtotal: $66,000 – $6,000 = $60,000.  
4) Add Tax-Exempt Interest: $3,000.  
5) Subtract Expenses Allocable to Tax-Exempt Interest: $500.  
6) DNI = $60,000 + $3,000 – $500 = $62,500.

This example shows how critical trustee decisions (i.e., partial allocation of capital gains to income) affect the results of the DNI calculation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Expanded Mermaid Diagram: Trustee Authority

Here is a more detailed diagram showing how trustee authority interacts with the classification steps:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A((Trust Document & State Law)) --> B{Trustee's Discretion}
    B --> C[Classify Receipts<br> & Outlays]
    C --> D[Income Bucket<br>(Fiduciary Accounting)]
    C --> E[Principal Bucket<br>(Corpus)]
    D --> F[FAI Calculation]
    E --> F
    F --> G((DNI Adjustments))
    G --> H[Final DNI <br> for Distribution & Taxation]
```

Explanations:
• The “Trust Document & State Law” node drives the trustee’s discretion.  
• The “Classify Receipts & Outlays” step leads to separate “Income Bucket” and “Principal Bucket,” forming the basis for FAI.  
• “DNI Adjustments” then incorporate capital gains, tax-exempt interest, and related items to yield final DNI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Simple vs. Complex Trusts: The DNI Application

Recall from Chapter 12.1:  
• Simple Trust: Must distribute all income currently, cannot make charitable contributions, and typically no principal distributions.  
• Complex Trust: Can accumulate income, distribute principal, or make charitable contributions.

In a simple trust, DNI essentially mirrors the amount that must be distributed annually. By contrast, a complex trust may distribute amounts less than or greater than its DNI (though only the distributed portion up to DNI is taxable to beneficiaries). Where less is distributed, the undistributed DNI remains taxable at the trust’s compressed rate structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Practical Tips for CPA Exam Success

1. Know the Distinctions: Memorize how FAI differs from DNI.  
2. Remember Key IRC Provisions: IRC §§641–663 govern trust taxation.  
3. Focus on Adjustments: Capital gains, tax-exempt income, and related expenses are common exam points.  
4. Practice Problems: Work through multiple scenarios to ensure you can quickly and accurately compute DNI during the exam.  
5. Watch for Trustee Discretion: The exam may challenge you to identify which portion of gains are allocated as FAI vs. principal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [ ] The total amount of tax-exempt income earned by the trust.  
- [ ] A measure identical to Distributable Net Income (DNI).  

> **Explanation:** FAI is based on trust law and state-specific principal and income rules, not directly on the federal tax return.  

### Which item is most commonly excluded from Distributable Net Income (DNI) if allocated to principal by the trust document?  
- [x] Capital gains.  
- [ ] Tax-exempt interest.  
- [ ] Authorized trustee fees.  
- [ ] Dividends.  

> **Explanation:** Capital gains generally remain at the trust level unless the trust instrument or state law directs otherwise.  

### What is the primary reason tax-exempt interest is added back for DNI calculations?  
- [ ] To reflect capital gain distributions.  
- [ ] To increase the trust’s personal exemption.  
- [x] To ensure the beneficiary is aware of the total income distributed, even if part is tax-exempt.  
- [ ] To deduct it further on the beneficiary’s return.  

> **Explanation:** Tax-exempt interest is included in DNI so the beneficiary recognizes the total economic amount received.  

### In a simple trust that must distribute all income, what typically happens to undistributed income at year-end for tax purposes?  
- [ ] It is carried over to the next year’s income.  
- [ ] It is taxed to the trust.  
- [x] It generally does not exist because all income must be distributed currently.  
- [ ] It is partially exempt from taxation.  

> **Explanation:** A simple trust distributes all income annually, leaving no undistributed income to be taxed at the trust level.  

### When computing DNI, which one of these amounts is subtracted from taxable income?  
- [x] Capital gains allocated to principal.  
- [ ] The trust’s personal exemption.  
- [x] Expenses related to earning tax-exempt interest.

- [ ] Qualified dividend treatment.  
- [x] Capital gains paid to beneficiaries for certain discretionary trusts.  
- [ ] K-1 items from a partnership inside the trust.  

> **Explanation:** The trust personal exemption is not considered in DNI, and typically capital gains (allocated to corpus) are ignored except when specified by the trust document or law.  

### What is one key difference between FAI and DNI?  
- [x] FAI is driven by the trust instrument and state law, while DNI is driven by federal tax rules.  
- [ ] They are both exactly the same amounts under normal circumstances.  
- [ ] FAI always includes capital gains.  
- [ ] DNI is calculated before expenses.  

> **Explanation:** FAI and DNI can differ significantly depending on allocations and federal tax adjustments.  

### In a complex trust, what happens if it distributes less than its DNI?  
- [x] The undistributed portion is taxable to the trust itself.  
- [ ] The undistributed portion is never taxed.  
- [ ] The undistributed portion reverts to the beneficiaries automatically.  
- [ ] None of the above.  

> **Explanation:** Any undistributed DNI remains in the trust and is taxed at the trust-level rates.  

### A trustee’s authority to classify capital gains as income or principal is typically found in the:  
- [x] Trust instrument and state principal-and-income statutes.  
- [ ] Federal Form 1041 instructions.  
- [ ] IRC §§651–652 only.
