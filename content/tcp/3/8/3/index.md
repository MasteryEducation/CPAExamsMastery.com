## 8.3 Transactions Between Shareholder & Corporation (Property Contributions, Stock Redemptions)

This section provides a comprehensive examination of how the tax code impacts transactions between a C corporation and its shareholders, focusing on property contributions and stock redemptions. Understanding the interplay between corporate-level gain, shareholder-level tax consequences, and common pitfalls—such as “bailouts” masked as redemptions—will enable aspiring CPAs to advise clients effectively and navigate potential traps that may arise in real-life transactions.

Developing a deep understanding of these issues also helps prepare you for the Tax Compliance and Planning (TCP) portion of the CPA exam. Notably, this section intersects with concepts from other chapters, such as basis and distributions (see Chapter 8.4 on Corporate E&P Calculations & Dividend Treatment), as well as considerations on corporate formations (Section 13.1 in Entity Choice & Formation Strategies).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction to Shareholder-Corporation Transactions

Shareholder-corporation transactions can take many forms, but the two most commonly tested (and practiced) scenarios are:

1. Property contributions by shareholders to a corporation.  
2. Stock redemptions by the corporation from its shareholders.

Both scenarios have potentially significant tax consequences at both the corporate level and the shareholder level. In particular:

• A corporation often does not recognize income when it receives property in exchange for its own stock if the requirements of IRC §351 are met (property contribution in exchange solely for stock).  
• A redemption may be taxed under IRC §301 as a dividend (to the extent of Earnings & Profits (E&P)) or, if specific conditions are satisfied, as a capital gain under IRC §302.

Careful analysis is required, especially when redemptions are used in ways that might disguise a dividend (colloquially called a “bailout”). In those instances, shareholders might attempt to extract earnings at preferential capital gains rates. The IRS closely scrutinizes these transactions to ensure that redemptions do not function as disguised dividends.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Property Contributions: An Overview

A shareholder who transfers property to a corporation typically expects that no immediate gain or loss will be recognized for federal income tax purposes. This nonrecognition treatment is primarily governed by IRC §351, which states that no gain or loss is recognized if property is transferred to a corporation by one or more persons in exchange for that corporation’s stock, and immediately after the exchange, the transferring persons are in control (generally at least 80% of total shares) of the corporation.

#### Key Requirements for §351

1. The Transfer Must Be of “Property.”  
   – Property includes cash, tangible assets, and even certain intangible assets such as patents, goodwill, etc.  
   – Services do not qualify as property for purposes of §351; receiving stock for services triggers taxable compensation to the service provider (and potential deduction for the corporation, subject to certain rules).

2. The Transfer Must Be in Exchange for Stock.  
   – The shareholder must receive stock (common or preferred).  
   – Receipt of “boot,” or non-stock consideration (e.g., cash, debt instruments), can partially disqualify or limit the nonrecognition.

3. Control Requirement (80%).  
   – Immediately after the exchange, the contributing shareholders must control at least 80% of both the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80% of the total number of shares of all classes of stock.

#### Basis Considerations

• Shareholder’s Stock Basis: Under §358, if the transaction qualifies under §351, the shareholder’s basis in the new stock received equals the basis of the contributed property, decreased by any cash received (boot) and increased by any gain recognized.  
• Corporate Basis in Property: Per §362, the corporation generally takes a carryover basis in the contributed property (the shareholder’s basis before the transfer), subject to certain adjustments for built-in losses.  

#### Liabilities in Excess of Basis (IRC §357)

If the shareholder transfers property subject to a liability exceeding the property’s adjusted basis, certain rules can trigger gain recognition. Specifically, §357(c) holds that a gain can be recognized to the extent liabilities exceed the aggregate adjusted basis of all property transferred. Practitioners must be careful to avoid inadvertently triggering taxable gain, often referred to as “negative basis” issues.

#### Effects on Corporate Earnings & Profits (E&P)

Property contributions that qualify under §351 do not automatically increase earnings and profits of the corporation; however, if the corporation assumes liabilities in excess of the contributed property’s basis, certain adjustments might be needed. Overall, capital contributions themselves generally do not create or utilize corporate E&P, but the subsequent disposition of contributed property—including built-in gains—can affect E&P down the road (see Chapter 8.4 for a more detailed discussion on Corporate E&P Calculations & Dividend Treatment).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Corporate-Level Impact of Property Transfers

When a shareholder contributes property to a corporation in exchange for stock (and the transaction meets §351 requirements), the corporation does not recognize income on the receipt of that property. However, there are special rules:

• Built-in gains or losses remain with the property inside the corporation. If the corporation later sells or disposes of that property, any post-contribution appreciation or depreciation, plus any built-in gains or losses at the time of contribution, will be recognized at the corporate level unless otherwise deferred.  
• The corporation’s basis in the asset is important for future depreciation, amortization, or gain/loss recognition when the asset is eventually sold.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Stock Redemptions: Taxation and Structuring

A redemption occurs when a corporation acquires its own stock in exchange for corporate property (often cash). The main question for a shareholder is whether the payment from the corporation is treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend (subject to the ordinary or qualified dividend rates) or as a sale/exchange resulting in capital gain. Whether a redemption is treated as a sale/exchange or a dividend depends on meeting one or more tests under IRC §302(b):

1. Not Essentially Equivalent to a Dividend (IRC §302(b)(1))  
2. Substantially Disproportionate Redemption of Stock (IRC §302(b)(2))  
3. Complete Termination of Shareholder’s Interest (IRC §302(b)(3))  
4. Partial Liquidations of Corporations (IRC §302(b)(4)) – Generally more relevant to noncorporate shareholders.  

If none of these tests are satisfied, §302(d) reclassifies the distribution as a dividend under §301, to the extent of corporate E&P, with any excess treated as a return of capital or capital gain.

#### Corporate-Level Consequences of Redemptions

• If a corporation redeems stock with cash, there is no direct gain or loss recognized by the corporation on the cash outlay.  
• If a corporation redeems stock with appreciated property, it must recognize gain as if it sold the property at fair market value (but cannot recognize loss on property that has declined in value). This is governed by IRC §311(b).  
• The corporation’s E&P is usually reduced in the amounts distributed. However, if the redemption is treated as a dividend at the shareholder level, the reduction to E&P is typically the amount of the redemption up to the corporation’s E&P balance.

#### Balancing Shareholder Consequences

• Dividends are typically taxable as ordinary or qualified dividend income. Qualified dividends may be taxed at favorable capital gains rates for individual shareholders, but remember that net investment income tax (NIIT) might also apply.  
• If the redemption is classified as a sale or exchange under §302(b), the shareholder can recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between redemption proceeds and the adjusted basis in the redeemed shares, which might be more favorable depending on the shareholder’s basis and tax situation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Disguised Bailouts: Avoiding Dividend “Recasts”

A “bailout” is a scenario where a shareholder attempts to withdraw corporate earnings at capital gains rates by structuring the transaction to appear as a stock redemption. The IRS focuses on whether the transaction genuinely qualifies under §302(b) or if it effectively accomplishes a dividend distribution.

Common triggers include:

• **Related Party Ownership:** Where the shareholder’s interest is not substantially reduced, or constructive ownership rules cause the shareholder to remain in control.  
• **Transitory Ownership:** A quick buyback of shares within family ownership structures can appear to be a redemption but lacks genuine reduction of ownership.  
• **Preferred Stock Bailouts:** Issuing preferred shares to the shareholder and then redeeming them shortly afterward, ostensibly returning capital but effectively distributing corporate earnings.

The IRS examines these scenarios carefully. Failing the tests (discussed above) under §302(b) results in the transaction being treated as a distribution under §301, taxed as a dividend to the extent of E&P.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pitfalls & Best Practices

Below are common pitfalls that practitioners and taxpayers should address, along with strategies to mitigate risks:

1. **Failure to Satisfy §351 Requirements:**  
   – Mistakenly including services in the exchange or not achieving 80% control can lead to unintended gain.  
   – Best Practice: Verify that each contributor receives only stock and that the 80% control test is met collectively.

2. **Excess Liabilities Over Basis:**  
   – Triggering immediate gain recognition under §357(c).  
   – Best Practice: Evaluate property’s basis and any attached liabilities before contributing. Restructure liabilities where feasible or contribute additional cash or assets to increase aggregate basis.

3. **Constructive Ownership in Redemptions:**  
   – Fails to reduce shareholder’s interest, causing reclassification as a dividend.  
   – Best Practice: Review family attribution and entity attribution rules. Consider disclaimers or trust arrangements carefully.

4. **Relying on Incomplete Terminations:**  
   – Attempting to claim a complete termination of interest but ignoring stock ownership by related parties.  
   – Best Practice: Carefully review the “family attribution rules” under IRC §318. Evaluate possibilities for a waiver of family attribution under specific conditions.

5. **Property Redemptions with Embedded Gains/Losses:**  
   – If a corporation redeems stock with appreciated property, it triggers corporate-level gain. If the property is depreciated, no loss is recognized.  
   – Best Practice: Consider a pre-redemption sale of depreciated property to generate a recognized loss if desired, followed by a redemption using the sale proceeds (so that any recognized loss is not lost in the redemption).

6. **E&P Tracking Errors:**  
   – Failing to keep accurate track of E&P changes due to redemptions or contributions can lead to misapplication of the dividend or capital gain rules.  
   – Best Practice: Maintain detailed schedules of the corporation’s E&P, especially with multiple distributions or redemptions in one tax year.

7. **Unwarranted Use of Preferred Stock Bailouts:**  
   – The attempt to issue preferred stock and quickly redeem it may draw scrutiny if it is effectively a disguised dividend to the shareholder.  
   – Best Practice: Ensure genuine business purposes exist for reorganizations or partial redemptions of preferred stock.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

1. **Example: Simple §351 Exchange with No Liabilities**  
   • Jessica contributes property with a $50,000 adjusted basis (FMV $80,000) to her newly formed corporation, receiving all 1,000 shares. She owns 100% of the corporation.  
   • No gain or loss is recognized. Her basis in the stock is $50,000, and the corporation’s basis in the property is also $50,000.  
   • If Jessica later sells some shares or if the corporation sells the property, the inherent gain or loss will be recognized accordingly.

2. **Example: Transfer with Liabilities Exceeding Basis**  
   • Malik contributes a building with an adjusted basis of $100,000 and a $120,000 mortgage.  
   • He receives 70% of the stock, combining with an existing 30% owner, achieving 100% control.  
   • Under §357(c), Malik may recognize $20,000 of gain because liabilities assumed by the corporation exceed his building’s basis.  
   • Careful planning might have avoided this by adjusting capital structure or contributing additional property.

3. **Example: Redemption Treated as a Dividend**  
   • Andrea owns 90% of Corp A. Her children own the remaining 10%. Andrea redeems 10% of her stock for $200,000, presumably a partial redemption.  
   • Because Andrea still holds 80% of the corporation, the transaction fails to meaningfully reduce her ownership under §302(b)(1) or (b)(2).  
   • Consequently, the $200,000 is taxed as a dividend to Andrea to the extent of Corp A’s E&P.

4. **Example: Complete Termination of Interest**  
   • Ben owns 30% of a corporation; unrelated parties own the other 70%. Ben redeems all his shares for $500,000.  
   • Because Ben has no constructive ownership through family members or other related entities, he meets §302(b)(3) for a complete termination.  
   • Ben’s entire redemption proceeds get capital gain treatment, assuming the redemption price exceeds his basis in the shares.

5. **Example: Property Redemption**  
   • Corporation X redeems shares from a 25% shareholder, Rachel, using a piece of real estate that appreciated in value by $100,000 above its basis.  
   • At redemption, Corporation X recognizes a gain of $100,000 (the difference between the real estate’s Fair Market Value and its adjusted basis).  
   • If the redemption does not qualify for sale or exchange treatment for Rachel, she is deemed to receive a $___ dividend (assuming E&P is sufficient).

```

Explanation: This diagram illustrates a straightforward §351 transaction where the shareholder transfers property solely for stock. If 80% control is maintained and no boot or liabilities in excess of basis come into play, the transfer is typically tax-free.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Diagram: Redemption Classification Process

    B -->|No| C[Dividend Treatment under §301<br>(to extent of E&P)]
    B -->|Yes| D[Capital Gain or Loss<br>(Sale/Exchange)]
```

Explanation: This flow shows the bifurcation between a dividend (ordinary or qualified dividend income) vs. a capital gain/loss determination. Whether the redemption is treated as a distribution under §301 or as a sale/exchange depends on meeting one of the §302(b) tests.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Corporate and Shareholder Perspectives: Balancing the Tax Burdens

• **Corporate-Level Gains**: A corporation that distributes appreciated property recognizes gain, treated as if sold at FMV. This gain increases the corporation’s E&P, possibly impacting dividend distributions for all shareholders.  
• **Shareholder-Level Consequences**: Whether a shareholder recognizes dividend vs. capital gain is critical. Capital gains often result in lower rates, but the required statutory tests must be satisfied, and family attribution rules cannot be ignored.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Real-World Strategies

1. **Pre-Transaction Planning**: Before contributing a property or entering a redemption agreement, evaluate the property’s basis, potential liabilities, and the corporation’s E&P.  
2. **Attribution Analysis**: For redemptions, thoroughly review under §318 to ensure that effective ownership is reduced.  
3. **Entity Structure**: Compare redemptions across multiple related entities. Section 304 can recharacterize brother-sister corporation stock transactions as redemptions, complicating the analysis.  
4. **Avoiding Pitfalls**: If the goal is to remove a shareholder entirely, a complete termination under §302(b)(3) is often more straightforward than partial redemptions.  
5. **Reasonable Counsel and Documentation**: If a transaction may appear to be a disguised bailout, thorough documentation of a valid business purpose can help refute that claim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Common Exam Traps

1. Confusing Treatment under §351 vs. §721: Remember that §721 applies to partnerships, while §351 applies to C corporations (and S corporations).  
2. Conflating Dividend vs. Capital Gain: Watch for partial redemptions that fail ownership reduction tests.  
3. Overlooking Family Attribution: The IRS uses constructive ownership rules heavily.  
4. Boot Pitfalls in Property Transfers: Even minimal boot in a §351 transaction can trigger partial gain.

## Quiz: Advanced Shareholder-Corporation Transactions

{{< quizdown >}}

### In a qualifying IRC §351 transaction, which of the following is generally true about gain or loss recognition?

- [x] No gain or loss is recognized by the shareholder or the corporation if the requirements are met.  
- [ ] The shareholder must recognize gain if the property’s fair market value exceeds its basis.  
- [ ] The corporation must always recognize gain upon receipt of property.  
- [ ] The shareholder’s basis in the contributed property is stepped down to zero.  

> **Explanation:** Under §351, assuming control is maintained and no boot is received, neither the shareholder nor the corporation recognizes immediate gain or loss. The corporation takes a carryover basis in the property, and the shareholder’s stock basis is generally the same as the contributed property’s basis.

### When does a liability assumed by a corporation in a §351 transaction trigger gain recognition for the contributing shareholder?

- [x] When the liability exceeds the basis of the property transferred (IRC §357(c)).  
- [ ] Whenever there are any liabilities, regardless of amount.  
- [ ] Only if the transaction fails the 80% control requirement.  
- [ ] If the property is intangible.  

> **Explanation:** Under §357(c), if the liabilities assumed exceed the adjusted basis of the property being transferred, the excess will be recognized as gain. This is a common pitfall for shareholders contributing encumbered property with relatively low basis.

### Which of the following best describes the impact at the corporate level if a C corporation redeems stock by distributing property with a built-in gain?

- [x] The corporation recognizes gain on the distribution as if it sold the property at fair market value.  
- [ ] No gain is recognized, but the E&P is automatically increased.  
- [ ] The distribution is always tax-free to the corporation.  
- [ ] The E&P is unaffected by property distributions.  

> **Explanation:** Under IRC §311(b), a corporation must treat distribution of appreciated property as if it were sold at FMV, triggering gain recognition at the corporate level. This can subsequently affect E&P.

### In determining whether a redemption qualifies for sale or exchange treatment, which one of the following is not a primary factor under IRC §302(b)?

- [x] Whether the shareholder personally needs the redemption proceeds for living expenses.  
- [ ] Not essentially equivalent to a dividend.  
- [ ] Substantially disproportionate redemption of stock.  
- [ ] Complete termination of the shareholder's interest.  

> **Explanation:** The taxpayer’s need for liquidity is irrelevant to the technical tax analysis. Instead, §302(b) focuses on ownership percentages and the change in control or ownership interests.

### Which of the following best characterizes a disguised “bailout” redemption?

- [x] A transaction intended to convert what would otherwise be a dividend into a capital gain.  
- [ ] A bona fide partial liquidation that meets all the §302(b)(4) requirements.  
- [x] A redemption structured to avoid dividend treatment without substantially reducing ownership.  
- [ ] A redemption specifically approved by the IRS prior to execution.  

> **Explanation:** Disguised bailouts typically try to take advantage of a redemption classification for capital gains treatment while failing the ownership reduction tests. The IRS scrutinizes these closely.

### How does family attribution under IRC §318 often affect redemption treatment?

- [x] Family ownership is attributed to the redeeming shareholder, potentially causing the redemption to be taxed as a dividend.  
- [ ] It has no effect on redemption classification.  
- [ ] It only applies if the shareholder is a minor child.  
- [ ] It is irrelevant if the shareholder has no siblings.  

> **Explanation:** Under §318, stock owned by certain family members is attributed to the redeeming shareholder, which can frustrate attempts to obtain capital gain treatment if the shareholder’s effective interest is not substantially reduced.

### Which of the following is generally not recognized at the corporate level when a corporation redeems stock for depreciated property?

- [x] Loss, per IRC §311(a).  
- [ ] Gain, if the property has declined in value.  
- [x] An immediate upward adjustment in shareholder’s basis.  
- [ ] Any undistributed E&P.  

> **Explanation:** The corporation cannot recognize a loss upon a redemption of stock using depreciated property. Section 311(a) prevents recognition of the loss on distributed property that has a fair market value below its basis.

### After a redemption is determined to be a capital transaction for the shareholder, how is the shareholder’s recognized gain or loss computed?

- [x] Redemption proceeds minus the shareholder’s adjusted basis in the redeemed stock.  
- [ ] The total fair market value of the corporation’s assets minus liabilities.  
- [ ] Only the portion that exceeds the corporation’s E&P.  
- [ ] Zero, because capital transactions are non-taxable.  

> **Explanation:** If the redemption is treated as a sale or exchange, the recognized gain (or loss) to the shareholder is determined by subtracting the adjusted basis in the redeemed shares from the redemption proceeds.

### If an existing majority shareholder contributes property and receives no additional shares, which statement most accurately applies?

- [x] The contribution is typically a capital contribution, increasing the shareholder’s stock basis if it is treated properly.  
- [ ] The transaction is a disguised sale under IRC §1001.  
- [ ] The corporation must recognize income on receipt of property.  
- [ ] The shareholder must receive at least 20% voting power.  

> **Explanation:** A shareholder can make a capital contribution without receiving new shares. In such scenarios, the shareholder’s existing shares often receive a basis adjustment, and the corporation’s basis in the property is determined under §362.

### A partial redemption is recharacterized as a dividend. True or False?

- [x] True  
- [ ] False  

> **Explanation:** If a partial redemption fails the tests under IRC §302(b) (including not essentially equivalent to a dividend, substantially disproportionate redemption, or complete termination), the law recharacterizes the entire distribution as a dividend to the extent of E&P.
