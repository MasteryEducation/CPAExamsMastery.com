## 10.3 Built-In Gains Tax & Historical C Corp E&P Integration

In this section, we delve into the complex but critical aspects of S corporations that have a history as C corporations (or that acquire assets from C corporations). We will discuss the built-in gains (BIG) tax—often regarded as one of the most important considerations when a corporation with appreciated assets converts to an S corporation—and explore how existing C corp earnings and profits (E&P) continue to affect the S corporation post-conversion. We will also provide a simple map for tracking recognized built-in gains and discuss the significance of holding periods for appreciated property stemming from earlier C corporation years.

Understanding these concepts is essential for both exam success (for the Uniform CPA Examination, Tax Compliance and Planning (TCP) section) and practical tax compliance in real-world engagements. After reading this chapter, you should be able to:

• Recognize how the built-in gains tax is triggered and calculated.  
• Distinguish between net unrealized built-in gain (NUBIG) and net recognized built-in gain (NRBIG).  
• Understand the significance of historical C corporation earnings and profits in an S corp context.  
• Develop a plan for tracking built-in gains and holding periods for appreciated assets.  
• Identify common pitfalls and best practices in dealing with built-in gains and historical E&P.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview of the Built-In Gains (BIG) Tax

When a corporation with accumulated appreciation in its assets elects S corporation status, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) imposes a built-in gains tax (under IRC §1374) on the inherent or “built-in” gains that existed at the time of conversion from C corp to S corp. The core rationale is to mitigate the perceived abuse of converting to an S corp merely to avoid corporate-level tax on the disposition of appreciated property.  

Key highlights of BIG tax include:

• It applies only to S corporations with prior C corporation years (or those that received assets from a C corporation in a tax-free transaction within the past five years).  
• The tax is imposed at the highest corporate tax rate on the net recognized built-in gain (NRBIG) during the recognition period.  
• The recognition period is the duration after the S election during which dispositions of appreciated assets (existing as of the date of conversion) may trigger the built-in gains tax. In recent years, legislative changes have shortened this recognition period to five years.  

This corporate-level tax is extremely important in practice, as even a one-time sale of a highly appreciated asset within the recognition period can generate significant—and often unanticipated—tax liabilities.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Net Unrealized Built-In Gain (NUBIG) and Net Recognized Built-In Gain (NRBIG)

To understand BIG tax, two crucial definitions come into play:

1. **Net Unrealized Built-In Gain (NUBIG):**  
   This is the amount of aggregate appreciation in the corporation’s assets at the time of the S election (or at the time assets were transferred from a C corp).  
   Mathematically,  
   NUBIG = (Fair market value of assets on the date of conversion) − (Adjusted basis of the assets on the date of conversion).

2. **Net Recognized Built-In Gain (NRBIG):**  
   During each taxable year of the recognition period, the S corporation calculates how much of that initial NUBIG is “realized” (via sale or exchange of the previously appreciated property) and is “recognized” for federal income tax purposes. The recognized amounts, across all assets, form the NRBIG.  

BIG tax only applies to dispositions of assets that had a built-in gain as of the date of the S election. If the corporation gains additional appreciation after the S election, that portion is not subject to the built-in gains tax (though it may be subject to regular taxes that apply to S corporation shareholders).  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Recognition Period and Recent Legislative Changes

Traditionally, the built-in gains recognition period extended over 10 years. However, various legislative enactments—including the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, and the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015—shortened the period to five years, making it permanent for most S corporations.  

Under the current regime, if an S corporation sells appreciated assets more than five full years after the S election (or five years after receiving appreciated assets from a C corporation), no built-in gains tax applies to the appreciation that existed at the time of the conversion. Hence, those considering a sale should carefully track the “start date” of their 5-year window.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Simple Map for Tracking Recognized Built-In Gains

A comprehensive yet straightforward approach to tracking recognized built-in gains involves a four-step method. This structure ensures that tax professionals maintain a consistent, year-to-year record of which assets are sold, what portion of sales price (or recognized gain) pertains to pre-conversion appreciation, and whether the corporate-level BIG tax applies.

Below is a simple map or flow to keep track of recognized built-in gains:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A((Start of Year)) --> B[Identify Assets with Built-In Gains at Conversion Date]
    B --> C[Calculate Each Asset's Unrealized Appreciation as of S Election]
    C --> D[Record Dispositions (i.e., Sales/Exchanges) During the Tax Year]
    D --> E[Determine Portion of Gain Allocable to Pre-S Election Appreciation]
    E --> F[Sum Gains & Apply Built-In Gains Tax Rate, Subject to NUBIG Limit]
    F --> G((End of Year))
```

1. **Identify Assets with Built-In Gains:** Maintain a schedule of each appreciated asset the corporation held when the S election occurred.  
2. **Calculate Unrealized Appreciation as of Conversion:** Document the fair market value and the adjusted basis of each asset on the date of conversion.  
3. **Record Dispositions:** Whenever an asset is sold or exchanged, note the sale price, the asset’s basis at the time of sale, and the portion of any recognized gain.  
4. **Determine What Portion is Pre-S Election Gain:** This step involves allocating total recognized gain between pre-S appreciation (subject to BIG tax) and post-S appreciation.  
5. **Apply Built-In Gains Tax:** The recognized portion of the pre-S built-in gains (NRBIG) is taxed at corporate rates, up to the limit of total NUBIG for that year (considering any net operating loss offsets or other adjustments).  

By carefully following this map each year of the recognition period, companies can maintain accurate records and avoid underpaying or overpaying taxes.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Determining Holding Periods for Appreciated Property from Earlier C Corp Years

A critical element in planning for the built-in gains tax is understanding the holding period for assets that have carried over from C corp years or were contributed by a C corporation. Generally, an asset’s holding period includes the time the asset was held as part of a C corporation’s property, enabling the controlling ownership group to track built-in gain from the date of acquisition (or, more precisely, from the date of the S election if the asset was already held).

Key points include:

• **Date-of-Conversion Holding Period:** The holding period for built-in gain computations is effectively “reset” for the recognition period once the S election becomes effective. In measuring the 5-year recognition period, the clock starts on the first day of the S corp’s first tax year.  
• **Inherited Assets from C Corporations (Transfers):** If a corporation transfers assets to an S corporation under a nonrecognition transaction (e.g., a §351 exchange) and those assets have built-in gain, that built-in gain may become subject to the BIG tax if disposed of within five years following the transfer.  
• **Carryover of Basis and Holding Period:** The basis of the property generally carries over, and for built-in gains tax purposes, the potential BIG is pegged to the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis at the time of the asset entering the S corporation.  

If the corporation sells the appreciated property after the recognition period ends, the built-in gains tax no longer applies to the portion that was pre-conversion gain, though the S corporation must still consider typical capital gains or ordinary income rules for S corporations (and pass-through separate or non-separate items to its shareholders).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exemptions and Special Rules Within the Recognition Period

It’s important to note that not all pre-conversion gains may be subjected to the built-in gains tax. A few circumstances—though complex in application—can lower or eliminate the built-in gains tax liability:

1. **Offset by Net Operating Losses (NOLs):** Some (often older) rules allow net operating losses or other tax attributes from the C corporation years to offset built-in gains for tax purposes. However, the interplay between carryovers and the BIG tax is intricate and requires careful analysis.  
2. **Limitations by NUBIG:** In a given year, the maximum amount of built-in gain subject to tax is capped by the overall net unrealized built-in gain at the time of S election. Once the cumulative recognized gain has exceeded that original figure, additional gains generally are not taxed under §1374.  
3. **Installment Sales from Prior Years:** If the C corporation had installment sales ongoing at the time the S election took effect, the portion of gain recognized during the S years that arose from pre-election appreciation might be subject to built-in gains tax.  

Because each of these scenarios can drastically affect the timing or magnitude of the built-in gains tax, S corp shareholders and tax advisors must ensure the S corporation’s records precisely reflect the relevant events.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Historical C Corporation E&P Integration

The presence of historical earnings and profits (E&P) from earlier C corporation years can trigger additional complexities for S corporations, especially concerning distributions and ongoing compliance. While an S corporation typically does not owe entity-level tax on its earnings—since income flows through to the shareholders—any E&P carried over from the C corp period remains relevant for distribution ordering rules and potential tax reclassifications.  

#### Distribution Ordering

When an S corporation with historical C corp E&P makes a distribution, the distribution ordering rules typically proceed as follows:

1. **From the Accumulated Adjustments Account (AAA):** Distributions to shareholders generally come first out of the AAA, representing post-S election income that has already been taxed to shareholders. Typically, these distributions are tax-free to the extent of the shareholder’s basis.  
2. **From Historical C Corporation E&P:** After exhausting the AAA, any additional distribution in the same tax year is deemed to come from the historical E&P of the C corporation. Such portions are typically taxed as dividends to the extent of that E&P.  
3. **Return of Capital:** If distributions exceed both AAA and C corp E&P, then the amounts reduce the shareholder’s stock basis to the extent possible.  
4. **Excess Distribution as Capital Gain:** If, after basis is fully depleted, the S corp continues to distribute funds, any further amounts to the shareholder are taxed as capital gain from the sale or exchange of the stock.  

Careful tracking of historical E&P is therefore critical. Distributions that exceed the AAA can create dividend income at the shareholder level—even though the S corporation form is generally assumed to be “flow-through.” For further discussion of distributions and AAA, see Chapter 10.2 “Shareholder Basis, AAA, Debt Basis & Distributions.”  

#### Mitigating the Impact of Historical E&P

S corporations may consider strategic approaches to mitigate the adverse effects or complexities of historical C corp E&P:  

1. **Pay Out C Corp E&P Before Electing S Status:** In some cases, a C corporation may elect to clean up its E&P by distributing dividends prior to the S election. While these distributions can be taxable to the shareholders, they may simplify matters going forward and reduce the risk of inadvertent dividend distributions later.  
2. **Check for Accumulated Earnings Tax:** If distributions are not made, large E&P balances may subject a C corporation to the accumulated earnings tax (if not used for reasonable business needs). Proper planning can avoid such outcomes.  
3. **Tracking Mechanisms:** Maintaining separate accounts for AAA and historical E&P ensures clarity in distribution calculations.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comprehensive Example

#### Fact Pattern
• XYZ Corporation is a calendar-year company that was formed as a C corporation in Year 1.  
• On January 1 of Year 6, XYZ Corp elects S corporation status. At that time, the corporation owns a warehouse purchased in Year 2 at a tax basis of \$100,000. As of the S election date, the fair market value of the warehouse is \$450,000, so the built-in gain for that asset is \$350,000.  
• The corporation also has \$200,000 of E&P from its C corporation years.  
• In Year 8, XYZ sells the warehouse for \$500,000.  

#### Analysis

1. **Built-In Gain Recognition**  
   - The built-in gain on the date of S election was \$350,000 (\$450,000 FMV − \$100,000 basis).  
   - By Year 8 (within the five-year recognition period if we assume current rules apply), XYZ’s basis in the warehouse has increased by allowable depreciation. Assume the adjusted basis in Year 8 is \$80,000.  
   - The total realized gain is \$420,000 (\$500,000 − \$80,000).  
   - Of that \$420,000, up to \$350,000 can be subject to the built-in gains tax, because it constitutes the pre-election appreciation. The remaining \$70,000 is post-election appreciation not subject to BIG tax.  
   - Therefore, XYZ’s net recognized built-in gain is \$350,000 in Year 8. XYZ would pay corporate-level BIG tax on \$350,000 at the highest corporate tax rate in effect for Year 8’s built-in gain.  

2. **Distribution Consequences**  
   - Assume after the warehouse is sold, XYZ distributes \$100,000 to its shareholders.  
   - Because XYZ is now an S corporation, it has an Accumulated Adjustments Account (AAA) that includes S corporation taxable income from Years 6, 7, and 8.  
   - The distribution first reduces AAA (assuming it is sufficient), hence resulting in no immediate tax to the shareholders (provided basis is sufficient).  
   - If the distribution exceeded the AAA, the corporation would then draw on the historical C corporation E&P of \$200,000, potentially classifying a portion as dividend income for the shareholders.  

This example underscores how built-in gains tax can impose a significant cost on assets sold within the recognition period, while historical C corp E&P can transform what was expected to be a tax-free distribution into a dividend. Tracking these two distinct items is absolutely essential for both tax compliance and planning.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Practical Considerations and Best Practices

1. **Early Valuation and Documentation:** Obtain reliable appraisals or third-party valuations of assets at the time of S election to establish the fair market value for BIG tax calculations. Inadequate or incomplete valuations can lead to disputes with tax authorities over built-in gain amounts.  
2. **Establish Clear Asset Ledgers:** Keep detailed schedules of each piece of property with the date-acquired basis, fair market value at date of S election, depreciation schedules, and subsequent adjustments. This ledger should also track dispositions, especially if the sale occurs within the recognition period.  
3. **Regular Distribution Reviews:** For E&P tracking, ensure that distributions conform to the ordering rules. This may require periodic analysis throughout the year to avoid unintentional dividend distributions or negative account balances.  
4. **Coordinate with Shareholders:** Because the built-in gains tax is a corporate-level tax, S corp shareholders may wish to coordinate corporate actions to delay asset sales or structure dispositions outside of the recognition period. Shareholder-level basis and tax considerations may also influence these decisions.  
5. **Stay Current with Legislation:** Although the 5-year recognition period has stabilized under current law, tax legislation can evolve. Staying informed can help the S corporation respond effectively to changes in the recognition rules or the corporate tax rate.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Common Pitfalls

• **Failing to Track Contributed Assets:** When an S corporation receives assets from a C corporation (e.g., a parent or related entity), the built-in gain must be tracked in relation to the time it arrived in the S corporation—even if the basis and holding period carry over.  
• **Misclassifying Distributions:** Inadvertently treating distributions from historical C corp E&P as tax-free returns of capital or as AAA distributions can subject the corporation (and individual shareholders) to additional penalties and interest if discovered.  
• **Overlooking Depreciation Recapture:** While computing built-in gain on depreciable assets, failure to account for potential recapture (under §1245 or §1250) can produce incorrect tax calculations.  
• **Assuming the 10-Year Window Applies:** Some corporations may rely on outdated knowledge that the recognition period is 10 years, missing out on opportunities to sell appreciated assets after Year 5 without incurring BIG tax.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Strategies for Minimizing BIG Tax and Distribution Planning

1. **Defer Asset Dispositions Beyond Five Years (Where Feasible):** If commercially viable, waiting until the recognition period ends can prevent the built-in gains tax from being triggered.  
2. **Structured Sales or Installments:** In some instances, spreading out gains over multiple years or using installment sales can limit the portion of gains recognized in the early years, though the complexity of tracking and allocation must be weighed.  
3. **Accelerated Distributions of AAA:** By distributing AAA before tapping historical C corp E&P, S corporations can keep shareholders from inadvertently incurring dividend income.  
4. **Proactive Pre-Election Dividends:** Some companies choose to pay down or eliminate C corp E&P before the S election, simplifying future distributions under S status.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### References for Further Exploration

• IRC §1374 and associated regulations for detailed rules on built-in gains tax.  
• IRS Publication 542, “Corporations,” which discusses C corporation tax fundamentals and references S corp transitions.  
• Chapter 8 in this text, covering “C Corporations,” for a refresher on E&P computations, dividend distributions, and corporate-level tax rates.  
• Chapter 10.2 for “Shareholder Basis, AAA, Debt Basis & Distributions” to understand how distributions interact with AAA and leftover E&P.  
• Chapter 19 for “Related Party Issues & Other Complexities,” which can affect how assets move between related C corps and S corps.  
• Chapter 18.2 regarding §1245 and §1250 depreciation recapture considerations for assets transferred from C corp to S corp.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Conclusion

Built-in gains tax stands at the intersection of the C corporation and S corporation regimes, ensuring that pre-conversion appreciation does not entirely escape the corporate-level tax. Similarly, historical C corp earnings and profits do not vanish upon an S election but instead must be tracked carefully, potentially leading to dividend distributions even under the S corporation umbrella. By understanding how built-in gains are determined, how to track them, and how historical E&P interacts with distribution ordering, tax professionals and business owners alike can develop robust strategies for compliance and financial planning.

Moreover, meticulous record-keeping, timely valuations, and careful monitoring of dispositions (particularly within the five-year recognition period) are essential to managing potential liabilities. Proper planning around distributions can also mitigate the risk of inadvertently creating dividend income for S corp shareholders. Building a working knowledge of these rules not only ensures compliance but also positions you to optimize tax outcomes for your organization or clients.

## Master Built-In Gains Tax & Historical E&P Quiz

{{< quizdown >}}

### Recognized built-in gain refers to which of the following?

- [x] The portion of pre-conversion appreciation actually realized on asset sales or exchanges during the recognition period.  
- [ ] Total post-conversion appreciation in corporate assets.  
- [ ] All capital gains an S corporation recognizes after it becomes an S corporation.  
- [ ] Only depreciation recapture on assets held from prior C corp periods.  

> **Explanation:** Recognized built-in gain (NRBIG) is the amount of pre-conversion gain that is realized in a taxable transaction during the recognition period, subject to the built-in gains tax under §1374.

### Which of the following statements best explains the recognition period for the built-in gains tax?

- [x] It is generally five years beginning on the first day of the first tax year the S election is effective.  
- [ ] It is a 10-year period that no longer changes with legislation.  
- [ ] It begins immediately upon the formation of the C corporation.  
- [ ] It depends on the total basis in the assets transferred.  

> **Explanation:** The PATH Act of 2015 made the five-year recognition period permanent unless future legislation alters it. After five full years, pre-conversion appreciation is no longer subject to the built-in gains tax.

### Which distribution is typically depleted first when an S corporation with historical C corp E&P makes a shareholder distribution?

- [x] Accumulated Adjustments Account (AAA).  
- [ ] Historical C corp earnings and profits (E&P).  
- [ ] Return of capital.  
- [ ] Capital gains distributions.  

> **Explanation:** Under the ordering rules, current or accumulated AAA is reduced first, followed by historical C corp E&P, then adjustments to shareholder basis, and finally capital gain treatment if distribution amounts exceed basis.

### An asset has a built-in gain of $150,000 as of the date an S election becomes effective. If it is sold within the recognition period, how much of the realized gain is potentially subject to built-in gains tax?

- [x] Up to $150,000.  
- [ ] Only $75,000 to account for depreciation recapture.  
- [ ] All post-conversion gain plus any recapture.  
- [ ] None of it, as all gains pass through to shareholders.  

> **Explanation:** The maximum amount subject to built-in gains tax is the original built-in gain that existed on the date of the S election. Any additional appreciation after the election is not subject to BIG tax.

### Which strategy can help minimize dividend treatment for distributions from an S corporation with leftover C corp E&P?

- [x] Pay out the Accumulated Adjustments Account (AAA) first.  
- [ ] Convert all historical E&P into capital losses.  
- [x] Distribute or reduce C corp E&P prior to electing S status.  
- [ ] Abolish the AAA account.  

> **Explanation:** Paying down or eliminating C corp E&P before conversion can mitigate the risk that later S corp distributions will tap into historical E&P and trigger dividend income.

### Which of the following can potentially offset built-in gains for tax purposes?

- [x] Net operating losses from prior C corp years, subject to applicable limitations.  
- [ ] Additional paid-in capital contributions.  
- [ ] Shareholder loan basis.  
- [ ] Passive activity losses booked in the S corporation after conversion.  

> **Explanation:** Certain tax attributes, like net operating loss carryforwards from C corp years, may offset recognized built-in gains in the first year of S status, although limitations apply. Other listed items typically do not reduce BIG tax.

### How does depreciation recapture interact with built-in gains?

- [x] Depreciation recapture is included in determining the recognized built-in gain subject to BIG tax if related to pre-conversion appreciation.  
- [ ] Recapture only applies to post-conversion assets.  
- [x] Recapture never triggers additional taxes during the recognition period.  
- [ ] Depreciation recapture is accounted for only at the shareholder level.  

> **Explanation:** Depreciation recapture on pre-conversion assets is considered part of the built-in gain if the reincorporation of that recapture meets the criteria for pre-election appreciation. This can increase the tax recognized under §1374.

### In the simple map for tracking recognized built-in gains, which step involves determining how much of the recognized gain is attributable to pre-S election appreciation versus post-S appreciation?

- [x] Determining the portion of gain allocable to pre-S election appreciation.  
- [ ] Identifying assets with built-in gains at the S election date.  
- [ ] Calculating the fair market value at the time of sale.  
- [ ] Summarizing post-conversion net profits.  

> **Explanation:** The outlined step specifically allocates the recognized gain between pre-S election appreciation (subject to BIG tax) and post-S election appreciation (which typically escapes BIG tax).

### What is a common pitfall when transitioning from C corp to S corp regarding built-in gains?

- [x] Failing to track the assets’ adjusted basis and FMV at the time of conversion.  
- [ ] Overpaying built-in gains tax due to zero unrealized appreciation.  
- [ ] Automatically classifying all assets as intangible.  
- [ ] Recording negative E&P at the conversion date.  

> **Explanation:** Inadequate tracking of bases and fair market values makes it impossible to correctly calculate net unrealized built-in gain at the time of the S election, thus jeopardizing compliance when assets are sold during the recognition period.

### S corporations with historical C corp E&P are completely free from dividend distributions.  
- [x] True  
- [ ] False  

> **Explanation:** This statement is actually false in practice—but the question form is reversed here (the correct choice is that the statement is false). Historical C corp E&P can cause some distributions to be characterized as dividends.
