## 33.2 AICPA Professional Standards Related to IT Audits

The rapid acceleration of technology in today’s business landscape has profoundly influenced how Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) approach audits, particularly those involving complex IT environments. As CPAs assume greater responsibilities for evaluating organizations’ information systems and controls, adherence to AICPA professional standards becomes crucial for ensuring high-quality, consistent, and reliable IT audit services. This section offers a comprehensive examination of the relevant AICPA standards that guide CPAs in planning, conducting, and reporting on technology-focused audits and attestation engagements.

This chapter builds on concepts discussed throughout the book—particularly from Part V: System and Organization Controls (SOC) Engagements—by focusing on the AICPA standards most pertinent to IT auditing. You will gain insights into how these standards shape CPA responsibilities, influence engagement scope, and promote consistency in evaluating controls.


Foundational Context of AICPA Standards

AICPA standards exist to heighten the quality, accuracy, and consistency of both attestation engagements and assurance services performed by CPAs. In the context of IT audits, these standards aim to help practitioners:

• Navigate the interplay between information systems and financial reporting.  
• Assess organizational risks arising from IT infrastructure, cybersecurity threats, and process automation.  
• Develop robust testing procedures for areas such as data integrity, system access, change management, and disaster recovery.  
• Evaluate control designs and operating effectiveness to ensure compliance with both internal and external requirements.  

Below, we explore the core sets of AICPA Professional Standards relevant to IT audits, discuss how they shape audit engagements, and illustrate potential scenarios that bring these standards to life.


AICPA Code of Professional Conduct and Independence

At the heart of any CPA engagement—whether focused on financial statements or IT systems—stands the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct. This foundational set of ethical rules provides guiding principles for integrity, objectivity, and professional skepticism.

• Independence Requirements: When conducting IT-related attestation services (e.g., SOC 1®, SOC 2®, or SOC for Cybersecurity), auditors must remain independent in both fact and appearance. This includes avoiding conflicts of interest and inappropriate consulting relationships with the client’s IT personnel that may threaten objectivity.  

• Confidentiality of Sensitive IT Data: CPAs often access privileged information—application design documentation, system architecture, encryption keys, and beyond. They must rigorously adhere to confidential client information standards to protect data integrity and comply with privacy laws.  

• Professional Skepticism: Evaluating complex IT environments, CPAs must maintain a questioning mindset and refrain from any assumption that management’s representations are free from potential oversight or error.  

Example in Practice: Suppose a CPA firm is engaged to conduct a SOC 2® examination on a cloud-hosting provider. During fieldwork, the auditors obtain details about the client’s custom firewall settings and critical security policies. The Code of Professional Conduct dictates that auditors protect this client data, using it only for professional purposes central to the engagement. Additionally, the CPA must remain independent, even if the firm has provided peripheral IT advisory services in the past.


Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) for IT-Focused Audits

While GAAS has traditionally centered on financial statement audits, many of its principles remain directly relevant to IT audits. The Clarified Statements on Auditing Standards (SAS), codified under AU-C sections, highlight requirements in areas such as:

• AU-C 315 – Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement: CPAs must consider the design and implementation of computerized controls, IT infrastructure, and automated transaction flows. Through walkthroughs, system flowcharts, and control testing, auditors identify risks that could lead to material misstatements.  

• AU-C 330 – Performing Audit Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks and Evaluating the Audit Evidence Obtained: This section guides the auditor on selecting and executing appropriate tests of controls (including IT controls) to gather sufficient and appropriate evidence. In IT-heavy engagements, professionals may use data analytics tools, interface testing, and specialized software to verify the accuracy and completeness of electronic transactions.  

• AU-C 500 Series – Audit Evidence: In an IT environment, evidence often includes log data, system configurations, user access management, and application control outputs. GAAS instructs CPAs on the reliability and sufficiency of such digital evidence, urging them to evaluate whether evidence from systems is trustworthy and effectively controlled.  

Practical Illustration: During an integrated financial statement audit, the auditor might realize that a large volume of sales transactions is processed via an automated interface between an e-commerce platform and the general ledger. Under AU-C 315, the CPA maps out the sales process to identify how the system captures, authorizes, and records revenue. Under AU-C 330, the auditor then performs tests of the application control that matches online orders to customer shipping confirmations. These steps uphold GAAS by delivering adequate assurance that sales figures are accurate and complete.


Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE)

Attestation engagements play a prime role in evaluating and reporting on controls at a service organization or on a subject matter other than historical financial statements. SSAE standards provide the framework for these engagements, and several of them are vital in shaping IT attestation services:

• SSAE No. 18: Introduced a conceptual framework for attestation engagements, building on prior standards (SSAE No. 16, which replaced SAS 70). This standard reorganized and clarified requirements for performing examinations, reviews, and agreed-upon procedures. Service Organization Controls (SOC) engagements, such as SOC 1® and SOC 2®, fall under the umbrella of SSAE 18.  

• Newer SSAE Updates: The AICPA periodically issues new SSAE versions (e.g., SSAE No. 19, 21, and beyond) to address emerging risks, such as cybersecurity, third-party vendor management, and the use of automation. These updates can introduce or refine requirements for the description of controls, management assertions, or the scope of testing.  

• Application to SOC Engagements: Notably, the SOC 2® framework tailors the controls to one or more Trust Services Criteria (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy), central to which is SSAE 18 guidance for verifying that controls are fairly described, suitably designed, and operating effectively.  

Case Scenario: A growing SaaS enterprise that processes sensitive user data requests a SOC 2® Type 2 report. In performing the examination, the CPA must follow SSAE 18 guidelines, ensuring they have robust documentation of management’s description of the system and verifying that the stated cybersecurity, availability, and confidentiality controls have indeed been operating effectively throughout the specified review period. The attestation procedures performed stem directly from the SSAE framework’s requirements on evidence gathering, independence, and reporting.


Key AICPA Audit and Attestation Pronouncements That Affect IT Audits

The table below provides an overview of several AICPA-pronounced standards that significantly influence how CPAs handle IT-related audits, reviews, or examinations:

| Standard/Pronouncement    | Core Focus                                    | Relevance to IT Audits                                                                |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AU-C 315                  | Understanding Entity & Risks                 | Identification of IT-based risks to financial reporting; system mapping & walkthroughs |
| AU-C 330                  | Responding to Risks & Gathering Evidence     | Tailored tests of IT general and application controls, data validation                 |
| AU-C 500 Series           | Audit Evidence                               | Reliability, timeliness, and quality of electronic audit evidence                      |
| SSAE 18 (SOC Engagements) | Examination, Review, AUP for Subject Matter  | Framework for SOC 1®, SOC 2®, SOC 3®, and specialized cybersecurity engagements         |
| AICPA Code of Conduct     | Ethics & Independence                         | Requirements for professional integrity, objectivity, confidentiality                  |


Relationship Between GAAS, SSAE, and the IT Audit Process

By combining GAAS’s emphasis on understanding risks and obtaining sufficient evidence with SSAE’s structured approach to attestation, CPAs have an overarching guide to performing thorough IT audits or IT-based attestations. The synergy ensures that:

• Engagement scoping recognizes IT controls critical to financial reporting and overall organizational objectives.  
• Testing procedures align with recognized professional methods, including control walkthroughs, sampling, data analytics, and inquiry with key IT personnel.  
• Reporting communicates results clearly, referencing the appropriate standard under which the engagement was carried out and clarifying the scope and limitations.  

Below is a visual representation of how these standards overlap in a typical IT audit or attestation engagement:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["AICPA <br/>Professional Standards"] --> B["GAAS <br/>(AU-C 315, AU-C 330)"]

    D --> E["SOC Reports <br/>& Assurance Engagements"]
```

In most scenarios, the CPA’s focus ranges from the widely accepted approach of GAAS in a financial statement audit to the more narrowly focused but critical steps of SSAE-based SOC examinations. Regardless of the engagement type, the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct remains a constant foundation for ethics and independence.


Common Pitfalls When Applying AICPA Standards in IT Audits

Despite the clear guidance offered by AICPA standards, IT audits can still present challenges. Below are a few common pitfalls and associated strategies to mitigate them:

• Overlooking Independence in Consulting Arrangements: If the same CPA firm designs or significantly implements an organization’s IT controls, it can compromise independence during an attestation. To mitigate this risk, ensure robust engagement acceptance protocols and separate consulting vs. attestation practices.  

• Insufficient Understanding of Complex IT Environments: Rapidly evolving technologies (cloud, IoT, blockchain) require specialized knowledge. CPAs should build or consult with a multidisciplinary team, including certified IT professionals, cybersecurity experts, and data analysts.  

• Underestimating the Importance of IT General Controls (ITGCs): Weak or unstable ITGCs (e.g., flawed change management or inadequate access controls) can compromise application-level configurations and data flows. Auditors should systematically test ITGCs before delving into application controls.  

• Improper Documentation: Both GAAS and SSAE standards emphasize the need to capture detailed working papers. Poor or incomplete documentation can lead to audit deficiencies, rework, and potential legal exposure.  

• Failure to Track Subservice Organizations: In SOC engagements, subservice organizations can significantly influence the overall control environment. CPAs must carefully delineate inclusive vs. carve-out methods to accurately represent how responsibilities and controls are allocated.


Best Practices for Navigating AICPA Standards in IT Audits

Below are several best practices aligned with the AICPA’s guidance:

• Invest in Ongoing Education: Regularly update competencies with the latest AICPA pronouncements, newly issued SSAEs, and emerging technologies that impact controls (robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, etc.).  

• Leverage Specialized Tools: Use audit software that can automate evidence collection, conduct advanced analytics, or verify user rights in complex IT environments.  

• Align ITGC Testing with COSO and COBIT Principles: As covered in Chapter 8 (IT General Controls) and Chapter 3 (Governance, Frameworks, and Regulatory Environment), bridging AICPA standards with industry frameworks enhances the consistency and depth of auditing procedures.  

• Integrate Risk Awareness into Every Phase: From planning to final reporting, keep IT-specific threats (e.g., ransomware, insider threats, zero-trust architecture) top of mind, and factor these into materiality assessments, sampling approaches, and conclusion formation.  

• Communicate with Stakeholders Early: In engagements like SOC 2® or integrated audits, stakeholder expectations regarding scope, timing, or the nature of testing can be intense. Early clarity aligns the IT audit process with organizational priorities, fostering smooth fieldwork and timely reporting.


Real-World Example of Integrating AICPA Standards

Imagine an international manufacturing company reliant on a fully automated supply chain management (SCM) system that integrates inventory metrics, purchase orders, and vendor payments. A CPA firm is engaged to conduct an annual IT review as part of the financial statement audit. Here’s how AICPA standards shape the engagement:

• The CPA references the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct for guidance on independence, ensuring no prior advisory conflicts exist.  
• Under GAAS (AU-C 315), auditors document business process flows that revolve around the SCM application, identifying potential points of IT failure where misstatements might surface.  
• The team designs and executes tests (AU-C 330) of the system’s automated reordering controls, verifying that reorder thresholds and vendor selections remain accurate and authorized.  
• If the company’s management requests additional assurance on controls over processing integrity for external stakeholders, the CPA might adopt the SSAE 18-compliant SOC 2® approach, focusing on the relevant Trust Services Criteria.  

This integrated approach ensures that IT control evaluations satisfy the demands of both the financial statement audit and potential attestation engagements, reinforcing stakeholder confidence in the automated supply chain’s reliability and overall financial reporting process.
