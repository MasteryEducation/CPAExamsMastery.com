## 1.3 Overview of the AICPA ISC Blueprint and Related Standards

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has introduced the Information Systems and Controls (ISC) domain in the Uniform CPA Examination Blueprint, effective from January 2025, to reflect the growing importance of technology in accounting, auditing, and advisory services. The ISC domain encompasses a range of competencies—from foundational IT concepts to complex frameworks, audit and assurance techniques, security controls, data management, and governance frameworks.

This section aims to:  
• Summarize how the AICPA’s ISC Blueprint catalogues essential competencies.  
• Illustrate how each chapter in this Supplemental Guide maps to the official AICPA content outlines.  
• Highlight the myriad of frameworks (COSO, COBIT, ITIL, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and others) and standards that underpin and influence the examination content.  
• Provide a foundational reference point for understanding prerequisites, knowledge areas, and their practical application in professional practice.  

By embedding these standards and frameworks within the ISC Blueprint, the AICPA ensures that newly licensed CPAs have the skills needed not only to navigate risk and compliance within digital ecosystems, but also to serve as trusted advisors in the face of technological evolution.

### Key Requirements in the AICPA ISC Blueprint

Although the levels of testing (i.e., remembering and understanding vs. application and analysis) vary across subtopics, there are recurrent competencies threaded throughout the ISC Blueprint:

1. **Risk Assessment**  
   The Blueprint stresses evaluating IT-related risks in various environments, including network infrastructure, databases, cloud environments, and outsourced operations.

2. **Internal Control Evaluation**  
   CPAs must assess design adequacy and operating effectiveness of IT controls—specifically ITGC (change management, access controls, operations) and application controls (input, processing, output controls).

3. **Regulatory Compliance**  
   Knowledge of frameworks such as COSO, COBIT 2019, and regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR is paramount. The AICPA situates CPAs at the intersection of these requirements, ensuring that they can advise on overlapping compliance mandates.

4. **Security and Privacy**  
   Greater emphasis is placed on cybersecurity measures, encryption, network security, vulnerability assessments, incident response, and privacy laws to manage data exposure risk.

5. **SOC Reporting**  
   The ISC domain heavily references assurance engagements involving SOC 1®, SOC 2®, SOC 3®, and SOC for Cybersecurity, focusing on scoping, testing, reporting, and client communication.

6. **Data Management and Analytics**  
   Expectations around data governance and the ability to leverage data analytic tools are embedded throughout the Blueprint. CPAs are tested on their capacity to interpret data flows, controls, and the reliability of data for financial and nonfinancial decision-making.

7. **Emerging Technologies**  
   The landscape of new technologies—like blockchain, robotic process automation (RPA), AI, and cloud computing—features prominently, with an emphasis on identifying the associated risks and recommending appropriate mitigating controls.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Relevant Standards and Frameworks

The ISC Blueprint references multiple governing frameworks, guidelines, and regulations that shape best practices in IT audits, risk assessments, and data management. Below is a concise summary of how these standards interplay with ISC competencies:

• **COSO Internal Control – Integrated Framework**  
  – A core framework for designing and evaluating internal controls, crucial in assessing IT controls within business processes.

• **COSO ERM Framework**  
  – Expands the focus to an enterprise-wide risk management approach, including technology-related risks and how they integrate into strategic objectives.

• **COBIT 2019**  
  – Provides an IT governance framework that complements COSO and offers detailed processes and control activities to ensure that information systems are effectively managed and aligned with enterprise objectives.

• **ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library)**  
  – Outlines best practices for IT service management, offering a structured approach to operations and service delivery that is increasingly relevant for CPAs engaged in operational audits.

• **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**  
  – Establishes controls around cardholder data security, a domain often subject to both regulatory examination and external assurance engagements.

• **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**  
  – Addresses health information privacy and security requirements, pertinent for CPAs performing audits or consulting in healthcare settings.

• **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**  
  – The European Union’s comprehensive data privacy law that has global implications for data processing and breach notification procedures, reflecting a shift toward more stringent privacy controls throughout the world.

• **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)**  
  – Widely recognized security controls guidance, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, used by various organizations seeking a benchmark for designing and measuring their information security posture.

Many of these frameworks and regulations share overlapping objectives regarding risk identification, control implementation, continuous monitoring, and governance. The AICPA expects CPAs to be familiar with these commonalities and to demonstrate their ability to integrate multiple frameworks simultaneously.

```

In this diagram, the AICPA ISC Blueprint branches out and integrates a variety of recognized standards and frameworks. Each framework contributes a unique perspective or set of controls, and, in turn, CPAs leverage these to fulfill examination requirements and meet professional obligations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Connecting the ISC Blueprint with Professional Practice

A key attribute of the ISC domain is its focus on practical application. Beyond passing the exam, newly licensed CPAs are expected to:

• Evaluate an entity’s current IT environment, identify gaps using frameworks like COSO, COBIT, or NIST, and propose enhancements that align with regulatory and compliance requirements.  
• Conduct or advise on external and internal IT audits, ensuring that the scope, testing approach, and documentation adhere to AICPA professional standards.  
• Collaborate with cross-functional teams in finance, operations, and IT to design integrated controls—especially in ERP implementations, data management, and cybersecurity contexts.  
• Serve in leadership roles when adopting emerging technologies, particularly around due diligence, risk assessment, design considerations, and strategic decision-making.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

Below are two brief scenarios to illustrate how integrative knowledge of AICPA requirements and industry frameworks might appear in practice:

1. **Healthcare Organization Undergoing a HIPAA Audit**  
   A mid-sized hospital system is concerned about safeguarding patient data. An internal audit reveals deficiencies in how electronic health records are protected and encrypted. A CPA specializing in IT audits references COSO to categorize controls, uses COBIT 2019 processes to guide improvements to the hospital’s IT governance, and advocates for aligning with HIPAA requirements to ensure compliance. The result is an enhanced security posture, reduced chance of future breaches, and improved audit readiness.

2. **SOC 2® Engagement in a SaaS Company**  
   A software-as-a-service (SaaS) startup preparing for a SOC 2® engagement engages a CPA firm to evaluate its security and availability controls. The CPA team leverages the Trust Services Criteria outlined by the AICPA and cross-references them against COBIT 2019 components. They test encryption procedures, data backup and recovery plans, and access management controls. The finalized SOC 2® report provides prospective clients with assurance about the startup’s control environment.

Such examples underscore the CPA’s evolving role beyond strictly financial audits to include evaluating and attesting to the effectiveness of technology controls.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

• **Best Practices**  
  – Embrace a holistic view: Integrate multiple frameworks (e.g., COSO and COBIT) to avoid narrowly scoped control designs.  
  – Stay informed: Keep up-to-date with changing regulations (e.g., GDPR updates) and technology trends.  
  – Document thoroughly: Maintain clear control documentation, test steps, and conclusions for external review.  
  – Foster cross-functional collaboration: Engage with IT, legal, compliance, and operational teams early and often.

• **Common Pitfalls**  
  – Overlooking subservice organizations or user entity controls in SOC 1® or SOC 2® engagements.  
  – Relying solely on a single framework without considering specific regulatory requirements or industry nuances.  
  – Underestimating the importance of cybersecurity given the rising threats in an interconnected world.  
  – Neglecting continuous monitoring or post-implementation assessments, leading to a decline in controls effectiveness over time.
