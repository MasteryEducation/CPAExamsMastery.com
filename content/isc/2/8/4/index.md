## 8.4 Computer Operations

Computer operations is a critical component of IT General Controls (ITGC), encompassing a range of day-to-day activities necessary to ensure that information systems function reliably and securely. These operations include job scheduling and workload management, system performance monitoring, backup and restore procedures, and handling common failures such as hardware outages, job delays, and data corruption. Properly designed and executed computer operations controls underpin the security, availability, and integrity of systems that process financial transactions and protect sensitive information—vital aspects for Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) assessing technology environments.

Because computer operations intersects with all other aspects of ITGC (e.g., access controls, change management, system development), strong collaboration between IT teams, internal and external auditors, and finance or accounting stakeholders is essential to maintain a robust control environment. This section will clarify key tasks, illustrate typical failure scenarios, and discuss best practices for effective continuous operations.

  
Key Concepts in Computer Operations
-----------------------------------

Computer operations comprises the daily hands-on responsibilities needed to keep IT infrastructure, applications, and data processing services running optimally. It often requires coordination among multiple teams—business units, IT administrators, database administrators (DBAs), and network engineers—under the oversight of IT directors or managers. The controls and processes in place for computer operations help ensure:

• Continuous Availability: Systems remain active and responsive to meet user and business demands.  
• Data Integrity: Processes function as intended without malignant or accidental corruption of data.  
• Timeliness of Processing: Jobs and tasks complete within established SLAs or operational windows.  
• Security: Unauthorized changes or disruptions to the system are minimized and promptly addressed.  

For an auditor, understanding these key concepts helps identify potential areas of risk within an organization’s operational environment. The more complex an organization’s technology landscape, the more crucial it becomes to maintain strict operational protocols.  

  
Common Tasks in Computer Operations
-----------------------------------

In the course of daily operations, IT teams must manage numerous tasks effectively and consistently. Key tasks typically include:

• Job Scheduling and Workload Management  
• Backup and Restore Procedures  
• Monitoring and Alerting  
• Logging and Reporting  
• User Support and Incident Response  
• Capacity Planning and Performance Management  

While the exact nature of these tasks varies depending on the organization’s size, industry, and regulatory obligations, most share common features outlined below.  

  
Job Scheduling and Workload Management
--------------------------------------

Job scheduling, also referred to as batch scheduling or workload automation, is a central component of computer operations. In many organizations, critical business processes—from nightly payroll aggregations to daily bank reconciliations—rely on execution of scheduled tasks or “jobs.” These workflows often involve file transfers, data loading, calculation routines, and data integration tasks that must run in a precise order.

1) Scheduling Tools and Automation  
   – Tools like cron (in UNIX/Linux), Windows Task Scheduler, or commercial enterprise scheduling systems manage start times, dependencies, and priority levels for each job.  
   – Advanced scheduling tools orchestrate workflows involving multiple systems and can reroute tasks if one system is unavailable.  

2) Dependencies and Handling  
   – Many jobs require input from the successful completion of upstream tasks (e.g., end-of-day finance reconciliations might depend on the timely capture of all cashier data).  
   – Scheduling tools often define job dependencies, which help avoid failures due to missing information or locked files.  

3) Job Logging and Notification  
   – Each scheduled job generates logs or status messages.  
   – Automatic notifications—via email, SMS, or chat tools—alert the operations team if a job surpasses a time threshold, encounters errors, or fails outright.  

4) Risk Considerations  
   – Job overlap or concurrency issues can create data corruption or performance bottlenecks.  
   – Auditors should confirm that scheduling logic is well-documented and traceable to business requirements.  

  
Backup and Restore Procedures
-----------------------------

backup and restore procedures ensure that mission-critical data is protected against loss, whether accidental or malicious (e.g., hardware failures, power outages, ransomware attacks). Effective controls bolster the organization’s resilience and business continuity.  

1) Types of Backups  
   – Full Backup: Captures all data in its entirety.  
   – Incremental Backup: Captures only changes since the last backup (full or incremental).  
   – Differential Backup: Captures changes since the last full backup.  

2) Storage and Retention  
   – On-Premises Storage: Retaining backups on local disk or tape.  
   – Offsite Storage: Business continuity regulations and best practices often require duplicates stored in remote or cloud repositories.  
   – Retention Policies: Typically derived from regulatory requirements (e.g., in financial services or healthcare) or organizational policies (e.g., 7-year retention for financial records).  

3) Restoration Procedures  
   – Regular Restoration Testing: Periodically verifying that backups can be successfully restored is critical in preventing “false sense of security.”  
   – Recovery Point Objectives (RPO): Determining how much data an organization can afford to lose.  
   – Recovery Time Objectives (RTO): Determining how quickly a system must be restored to functional status post-incident.  

4) Risk Considerations  
   – Incomplete Backups: Failing to capture all necessary data can hamper recovery.  
   – Unsecured Backup Media: Physical or logical theft of backups can lead to data breaches.  
   – Lack of Testing: Backups without verification may be useless if they cannot be restored properly.  

  
Monitoring and Alerting
-----------------------

Continuous monitoring is integral to detect and address operational anomalies in real-time. An effective monitoring framework includes:

• Infrastructure Monitoring: CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space, and network bandwidth.  
• Application Monitoring: Error logs, transaction response times, concurrency loads, application-specific metrics.  
• Security Monitoring: Intrusion detection systems, firewall logs, event correlation tools, suspicious login attempts.  
• Automated Alert Systems: Triggers that notify administrators via dashboards, messages, or calls when thresholds are breached or errors are detected.  

Timely alerts enable rapid incident response, which is especially important for critical financial systems where downtime or data corruption can have significant monetary impact.  

  
Logging and Reporting
---------------------

Detailed logging is a fundamental requirement for both day-to-day operational diagnostics and forensic investigations. Logs provide:

• Visibility into System Behavior: Transaction flows, user actions, error details, and event timestamps.  
• Data for Auditing: Validates system performance and demonstrates regulatory compliance.  
• Inputs for Analytics: Logs can be fed into data analysis tools or SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platforms for anomaly detection.  

Operational and security reports drawn from logs help management and auditors see trends, isolate error-prone areas, and validate that controls function as intended.  

  
User Support and Incident Response
----------------------------------

Computer operations teams frequently deal with user support queries—password resets, changing access rights, troubleshooting application latency issues, or diagnosing printing errors. While some organizations have specialized helpdesks or service desks, in smaller institutions the same team that handles job scheduling might also respond to user tickets.

Incident response goes beyond basic troubleshooting and involves diagnosing and remediating major outages, data corruption incidents, security breaches, or compliance violations. As detailed in Chapter 20 (Incident Response and Recovery), organizations with well-documented incident response plans, escalation paths, and external communication guidelines navigate crises more effectively.  

  
Capacity Planning and Performance Management
-------------------------------------------

Sustaining reliable operations requires anticipating future resource needs. Capacity planning involves:

• Forecasting Growth: Estimating data increases, new applications, or user volumes.  
• Monitoring Key Metrics: Memory, CPU load, storage consumption, and network bandwidth to avoid performance bottlenecks.  
• Resource Provisioning: Scaling hardware or acquiring additional cloud compute/storage as usage expands.  

Performance management ensures that the system operates efficiently to meet service level agreements (SLAs) and user expectations while balancing cost constraints.  

  
Typical Failure Scenarios and Case Studies
------------------------------------------

No matter how robust the operational environment, failures can and do occur. Well-prepared organizations design controls and procedures to mitigate, detect, and recover from failures quickly.

1) Hardware Failure  
   – Servers, storage disks, or mainframe components can malfunction.  
   – Example: A manufacturing company’s database server suffers a disk crash, halting production data entry. Impact is minimized by quickly swapping to a mirrored drive system.  

2) Software Errors and Job Failure  
   – Batch jobs or scheduled runs may fail due to coding errors, erroneous data, or missing file dependencies.  
   – Example: A financial services firm experiences a nightly credit card processing job error. A single configuration mistake in the scheduling tool omitted a required preceding task. The error is discovered by the operations team, who reruns the correct sequence immediately.  

3) Power Outages or Environmental Issues  
   – Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and backup generators mitigate local power disruptions but cannot always withstand extended outages.  
   – Example: A mid-sized retail chain’s data center goes dark when a sustained regional outage outlasts the generator’s fuel supply. Having offsite replicated servers enables them to failover critical operations to a geographically distant data center.  

4) Ransomware Attacks  
   – Malicious actors encrypt production data and demand payment for decryption keys.  
   – Example: A healthcare provider’s entire patient management system becomes locked. Because the organization maintained offline backups, they can restore from a clean snapshot with minimal data loss.  

5) Network Failures  
   – Routers, switches, or firewall malfunctions can segment or isolate an organization from external systems.  
   – Example: A large bank’s cross-site data replication halts due to a router failure. Failover to a secondary network path ensures continued replication.  

  
Practical Tools and Approaches
------------------------------

To reinforce computer operations, organizations deploy comprehensive tools and governance structures:

• Enterprise Scheduling Solutions: Tools like IBM Tivoli Workload Scheduler, ActiveBatch, or BMC Control-M.  
• Systems and Event Monitoring: Tools like Nagios, Zabbix, Splunk, or dedicated SIEM solutions for more advanced security event correlation (also see Chapter 17 and Chapter 21).  
• Backup Solutions: Enterprise backup suites like Veeam, Veritas NetBackup, Commvault, or built-in cloud backup for workloads on AWS, Azure, or GCP.  
• Incident Management Platforms: ITIL-aligned solutions like ServiceNow or Jira Service Management to track, prioritize, and document incidents.  
• Cloud Operation Tools: Services from major cloud providers (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Operations) integrate job scheduling, application performance monitoring, and resource scaling.

Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
----------------------------------

Implementing best practices across computer operations can help organizations strengthen system resiliency and accuracy, reduce downtime, and maintain compliance:

Best Practices  
• Define and Document SOPs: Written standard operating procedures detail steps for scheduling, backup, and incident response.  
• Automate Whenever Feasible: Reduce human error by utilizing tools to orchestrate job workflows, backups, and monitoring.  
• Test Backup Restores Regularly: Practice restoring data from backups in a controlled environment to ensure reliability.  
• Segregate Duties: Clearly separate scheduling responsibilities from development and testing.  
• Implement Role-Based Access: Restrict operational tasks to authorized personnel with a legitimate need.  
• Maintain Comprehensive Logs: With retention policies that satisfy legal and regulatory requirements.  
• Enhance Monitoring: Use robust threshold management, real-time alerts, and dashboards.  

Common Pitfalls  
• Overdependence on Manual Processes: Too many manual steps can lead to errors or missed tasks.  
• Lack of Job Dependencies: Failing to define job sequencing can cause partial or corrupt data sets.  
• NSufficient Storage for Backups: Running out of space mid-backup or storing backups on the same hardware that hosts production data.  
• Infrequent Audits of Environmental Factors: Failing to track temperature, humidity, or other environmental metrics in data centers can cause hardware failures.  
• Missing or Incomplete Documentation: Makes it hard for new staff or auditors to reconstruct critical processes.  
• Reactive Maintenance Only: Postponing performance tuning or hardware refresh can lead to unexpected bottlenecks or failures.  

  
Conclusion and Further References
--------------------------------

Well-structured computer operations ensure stable, secure, and timely processing of critical business data—especially for financial or regulatory reporting needs. CPAs working within or advising organizations on IT controls will find that robust computer operations significantly reduce operational risk, enhance data integrity, and enable reliable financial processing. Auditors are encouraged to map operational tasks (e.g., job scheduling, backup management, incident response) to organizational frameworks such as COBIT or COSO to identify any control deficiencies.
