## 28.1 AI, Machine Learning, and Neural Networks

Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Neural Networks each represent significant advancements in the way businesses, including CPA practices, handle and interpret data. Although these terms are often used interchangeably, they each refer to distinct but related fields:

• Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad domain encompassing systems designed to mimic human intelligence.  
• Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.  
• Neural Networks are computational models, often inspired by the human brain’s architecture, that underlie many modern ML approaches, especially deep learning.

In today’s finance and accounting landscape, these technologies offer new ways to tackle everything from routine transaction processing to sophisticated audit analytics. As a CPA, you do not need to be a data scientist to understand how AI and ML can improve financial integrity or influence internal control design, but a high-level understanding is increasingly essential. This section introduces foundational AI, ML, and neural network concepts and explores how each can affect financial data management, risk assessment, and broader business decision-making processes. It also emphasizes important considerations for safeguarding internal controls and data integrity in technology-driven environments.

### Relevance of AI and ML to the CPA Profession

Financial professionals now utilize AI and ML technologies to execute various tasks, including automated invoice processing, revenue forecasting, fraud detection, chatbots for client advisory, and more. For CPAs, these tools can enhance the efficiency and reliability of both audit procedures and advisory services. Key advantages include:

• Speed and Scalability: ML algorithms can process and analyze massive datasets faster than conventional spreadsheet-based methods.  
• Enhanced Accuracy: Properly trained models can reduce manual errors in transaction classification, reconciliation, or bank statement matching.  
• Real-Time Insights: AI-enabled dashboards can monitor transactions and flag anomalies in near-real-time, assisting CPAs in proactive risk mitigation.  
• Advanced Predictive Capabilities: Predictive analytics tools deliver insights into potential future risks, cash flow forecasts, and credit exposures, allowing better strategic planning.  

### Foundational Concepts in AI and ML

AI and ML involve the collection, preparation, and use of data to build, train, test, and deploy algorithms. Although the technical details can get complex, the basic workflow typically includes:

1. Data Collection: Gathering data from internal systems (e.g., ERP, general ledger, point-of-sale) and external sources (e.g., market data, economic statistics).  
2. Data Preparation: Cleaning, transforming, and encoding data for compatibility with specific ML algorithms. Refer to Chapter 11 (Data Life Cycle and Governance) for more on data classification and quality management.  
3. Model Building: Selecting an appropriate algorithm—such as supervised learning for classification or regression, or unsupervised learning for anomaly detection.  
4. Training: Feeding historical data into the model so it can “learn” patterns.  
5. Testing and Validation: Assessing the model’s accuracy and reliability on new or withheld data.  
6. Deployment and Monitoring: Integrating the model into operational workflows, establishing ongoing monitoring for performance and risk indicators.

### The Role of Neural Networks

Neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures, represent one of the most effective ways to implement ML for complex financial tasks. Mimicking the structure of the human brain, these networks consist of layers of “neurons” that transform inputs (transactional data, for example) into desired outputs (classified or forecasted results). Neural networks excel in tasks requiring recognition of subtle, non-linear relationships—an essential advantage for detecting fraud, recognizing unusual credit patterns, or processing unstructured data (e.g., voice or text in chatbots).

Despite their potential, neural networks can seem like “black boxes” because it may not always be clear how the model reached its conclusion. This poses unique challenges for auditors and risk committees responsible for verifying the reliability and fairness of AI-driven decisions. CPAs should be aware of recently developed techniques such as *Explainable AI (XAI)*, which aim to increase transparency around model outputs (see sections on risk assessment and internal controls below).

### Potential Impact on Financial Data and Internal Controls

AI-driven systems directly affect financial workflows—from initial bookkeeping to complex reconciliations, risk evaluations, and control structures. Below are a few critical areas of impact:

• Transaction Processing and Reconciliation: Systems that rely on AI to classify journal entries can reduce manual errors but must be carefully monitored to avoid misclassifications or overlooked outliers.  
• Fraud Detection and Prevention: ML is highly effective at identifying anomalies in transaction patterns, vendor relationships, or employee expense reports, helping CPAs spot fraud earlier.  
• Automated Journal Entries: AI tools can automate repetitive or high-volume journal entries, thus reducing the risk of human error but requiring robust controls to confirm the validity of auto-postings.  
• Continuous Auditing and Monitoring: AI can support near-real-time review of transactions against established criteria, alerting controllers to suspicious activities when they happen (refer to Chapter 14: Data Integration and Analytics for more on continuous monitoring techniques).  

From an internal control standpoint, key considerations include:

1. Data Access Controls: Controlling who can feed data into the AI system and ensuring that all data is validated before training.  
2. Change Management in AI Models: Approaches to updating or retraining algorithms must follow strict versioning controls, similar to the IT change management frameworks discussed in Chapter 10.  
3. Model Governance: In complex organizations, a governance structure is essential to validate model performance, guard against bias, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.  
4. Periodic Testing and Auditing: Ongoing review of outcomes by internal audit or external auditors is crucial for confirming the model’s proper functioning.

### Case Study: AI at Work in an Accounting Firm

Consider a mid-size accounting firm struggling with the volume of invoices and purchase orders from numerous clients. Management deploys an AI-powered invoice processing tool to classify transactions more quickly and accurately. As the system handles roughly 10,000 invoices per month:

• Staff who previously spent hours on manual data entry are reallocated to higher-level tasks such as data analysis and client relationship management.  
• The system flags suspicious entries based on prior transaction patterns, reducing the risk of internal purchase order fraud.  
• The internal audit team sets up weekly checks to compare the AI outputs against a sample of transactions manually processed, thereby verifying consistency.  

By blending automation with ongoing human oversight, the firm bolstered control effectiveness while improving employee productivity.

### Key Considerations for CPAs

#### Data Quality and Bias

ML algorithms are only as good as the data on which they are trained. Poor-quality data can yield misleading insights, resulting in inaccurate financial reporting or misguided audit findings. Biased data can lead to discriminatory analyses, especially for systems that evaluate credit risk or customer behavior. CPAs should investigate data governance practices (see Chapter 11) and internal controls around data classification and retention to ensure the model’s outputs are reliable and ethically sound.

#### Model Governance and Explainability

Explainable AI (XAI) techniques have become increasingly important for auditors who must validate and rely upon AI-driven decisions. Feature importance charts, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and Shapley values are among the methods used to interpret neural networks. Although deep learning models are more difficult to interpret than linear regressions or decision trees, CPAs should at least understand the fundamentals of how these techniques work to ensure compliance with relevant accounting standards.

#### Regulatory Requirements

Regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other standard setters continue to issue guidance on the use of AI in financial services. Requirements may focus on the accuracy of disclosures, non-discriminatory lending practices, or data privacy laws. CPAs must keep abreast of these evolving regulations to effectively advise clients. Additionally, frameworks like COSO’s Internal Control—Integrated Framework (refer to Chapter 3.1) guide management in establishing controls that remain effective even when AI-based components are embedded in core financial processes.

#### Risk Assessment and Integration with Existing Controls

AI introduces new vulnerabilities across the technology stack. For instance, if a neural network is compromised or spoofed, outputs may be manipulated to camouflage fraudulent postings or transactions. CPAs should integrate AI risk considerations into broader IT control frameworks such as ITGCs (Chapter 8) and business continuity planning (Chapter 9). A thorough risk assessment includes:

• Verifying who has authority to train, modify, or update AI models.  
• Reviewing the integrity of training data.  
• Ensuring robust backup and replication processes to avoid data corruption in model training.
