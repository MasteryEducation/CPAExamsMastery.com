## 22.5 Challenges and Evolving Standards in ESG

As Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) insights become increasingly crucial to investors, regulators, and stakeholders, assurance professionals must navigate a complex and dynamic landscape. This landscape is characterized by diverse reporting frameworks, rapid regulatory changes, data collection hurdles, and heightened scrutiny over “greenwashing.” In this section, we explore how auditors can effectively address challenges and stay current with evolving ESG standards to fulfill their professional responsibilities.

### 1. Lack of Universal Standard

A key challenge in ESG reporting is the absence of a single, universally recognized set of standards. Multiple frameworks—such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)—offer guidance for ESG disclosures. Each framework has a slightly different scope, set of metrics, and target audience, resulting in overlapping reporting requirements and, sometimes, confusion for both preparers and auditors.

The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), established by the IFRS Foundation, aims to address these inconsistencies by unifying various frameworks into a single set of global sustainability disclosure standards. This convergence initiative is an ongoing process; while the ISSB has made significant strides, complete alignment will take time as different stakeholders negotiate best practices and definitions.

#### Practical Implications and Tips
• Familiarize yourself with the major frameworks and the types of disclosures they require.  
• Monitor the ISSB’s ongoing projects and publications to stay updated on convergence efforts.  
• Engage in pilot studies or committees focused on consolidating ESG metrics to streamline internal processes and better prepare for upcoming changes.

### 2. Data Collection Complexity

Collecting high-quality, reliable data for ESG disclosures is often a daunting task. Unlike financial data, which is stored in robust enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, ESG data may come from disparate sources such as environmental sensors, community engagement programs, or thousands of suppliers worldwide. Inconsistent or siloed systems can hinder auditors’ efforts to verify completeness and accuracy, increasing the potential for error or omission.

In some cases, auditors must rely on third-party certifications, particularly when dealing with environmental metrics (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions from remote suppliers). Assurance professionals need to evaluate the credibility of these third-party certifications and ensure that reliance on external data does not undermine the overall robustness of the engagement.

#### Example
A multinational retailer may source products from factories around the globe, each using different data formats, local environmental standards, and tracking mechanisms for labor practices. Pulling this information together in a consistent, comparable manner requires careful coordination, technology investments, and clear guidance from management. Auditors thus become key advisors, recommending process improvements and better data architecture to facilitate reliable ESG reporting.

#### Best Practices
• Implement standardized data collection tools and processes across all business units.  
• Use technology solutions (e.g., data analytics platforms, blockchain-based supply chain tracking) to enhance data visibility and reliability.  
• Perform data validation checks and sample physical verification (e.g., visits to suppliers) where feasible.

### 3. Greenwashing Concerns

The term “greenwashing” refers to the misrepresentation or exaggeration of a company’s environmental friendliness or sustainability achievements. As ESG reports gain popularity, companies may highlight favorable metrics while downplaying less flattering performance indicators. This selective reporting undermines transparency and can mislead stakeholders.

For external auditors, skepticism is vital. Examine the supporting documentation for every ESG claim, especially those highlighted prominently in corporate sustainability reports. Challenge assumptions, inquire about omitted metrics, and consider the full context of ESG disclosures. Auditors must remain alert to any inconsistencies or potential manipulation of performance data.

| Indicator        | Possible Greenwashing Risk                 | Mitigation Strategy                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Emissions Data   | Cherry-picking only scope 1 or 2 data      | Verify inclusion of scope 3 emissions, question omissions|
| Social Practices | Highlighting local charity but ignoring labor issues in supply chain | Perform in-depth supplier audits                         |
| Governance       | Citing broad DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) goals without actual progress | Request documented evidence of promotions, hires, and pay |

### 4. Regulatory Pressures

Governments and regulatory bodies are adopting new requirements to close existing gaps in ESG disclosures. The European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), for example, broadens the scope of sustainability reporting for companies operating in EU member states. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed climate disclosure rules that would significantly heighten reporting requirements for listed companies. These regulations are raising the stakes for compliance and assurance, as non-compliance could result in fines, legal challenges, and reputational damage.

#### Reference Materials
• Proposed SEC climate disclosure rules in the U.S. (available on [sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/))  
• “Greenwashing and the New Role of Assurance” in Harvard Business Review  
• IFRS Foundation podcast episodes on ISSB progress and challenges  

#### Key Takeaways
• Keep abreast of changing regulations in all jurisdictions where the company operates.  
• Strengthen internal controls over ESG data to meet the rigorous requirements for external reporting.  
• Collaborate with legal counsel and sustainability experts to interpret and implement emerging rules.

### Glossary

• **Greenwashing**: Misrepresenting or exaggerating a company’s environmental friendliness or sustainability achievements, often to gain a competitive edge or improve public perception.  
• **ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board)**: Established by the IFRS Foundation to develop a global, consistent approach to sustainability disclosure standards, aiming to unify frameworks.  
• **Convergence**: Efforts to harmonize or unify separate, often overlapping, national or sector-based ESG frameworks into a single global standard.

### Looking Ahead

The ESG assurance environment will evolve in parallel with heightened stakeholder expectations, technological innovations, and regulatory reforms. Auditors and assurance professionals who invest in specialized expertise, robust data handling systems, and a thorough understanding of ESG frameworks are well-positioned to guide organizations through these challenges. By maintaining professional skepticism and advocating best practices, external auditors will continue to play a foundational role in the integrity and trustworthiness of ESG disclosures.
