## 20.6 Considerations for System and Organization Control (SOC) for Cybersecurity

System and Organization Control (SOC) for Cybersecurity is an emerging area of attestation services specifically designed to address an organization's entity-wide cybersecurity risk management program. As cyber threats evolve and become more sophisticated, organizations increasingly need to demonstrate to stakeholders—from investors and customers to regulatory agencies—that they have robust cybersecurity processes, policies, and controls in place. This voluntary examination, guided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), can help organizations strengthen stakeholders' confidence by providing an independent CPA's opinion on the design and operating effectiveness of cybersecurity controls.

This section explores the foundational elements of SOC for Cybersecurity, including the Description Criteria, Trust Services Criteria tailored for cybersecurity objectives, and specialized reporting considerations. By mastering these underlying concepts, exam candidates and practitioners can better appreciate how SOC for Cybersecurity engagements fit into the broader framework of assurance services, and how they may serve clients seeking to enhance their cybersecurity posture and transparency.

### 1. Overview of SOC for Cybersecurity

A SOC for Cybersecurity engagement is a voluntary, entity-wide cybersecurity examination. Unlike other SOC reporting options that focus on a specific system or set of controls, SOC for Cybersecurity covers the entire organization’s cybersecurity risk management program. The CPA’s objective is to form an opinion on whether the cybersecurity description is presented fairly, and whether the controls described are suitably designed and operating effectively to meet the organization’s security objectives.

Key goals of a SOC for Cybersecurity engagement include:  
• Providing stakeholders with confidence in the organization’s ability to identify, respond to, and mitigate cyber threats.  
• Demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of cybersecurity procedures, policies, and controls.  
• Delivering a credible, standardized report to address the increasing regulatory and market pressures around cybersecurity risk management.

---

### 2. Description Criteria

Central to a SOC for Cybersecurity engagement is the organization’s cybersecurity risk management program description. The AICPA provides specific criteria that management must address when developing and presenting this description:

1. Objectives of the Cybersecurity Risk Management Program  
   – Management should clearly communicate the ultimate goals of their cybersecurity efforts (e.g., protection of intellectual property, safeguarding personal data, operational continuity).  
2. Nature of Information at Risk  
   – The description must include types of data or information assets encompassed by the cybersecurity program.  
3. Components of the Cybersecurity Program  
   – A thorough depiction of the organization’s policies, procedures, and controls designed to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents.  
4. Risk Assessment Process  
   – Criteria should outline how management identifies and evaluates new and ongoing cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities.  
5. Control Environment and Organization’s Structure  
   – The description must demonstrate adequate oversight, responsibility assignments, and support from leadership.  
6. Communication and Information  
   – Channels and processes for sharing security-related information internally and externally (e.g., incident notifications) must exist.  
7. Monitoring and Ongoing Evaluations  
   – Activities used to track the effectiveness of the cybersecurity program over time, including performance measurements and control testing.

By adhering to these description criteria, management provides a holistic view of the organization’s cybersecurity environment, forming the basis for the CPA’s evaluation.

### 3. Trust Services Criteria (TSC) for Cybersecurity 

The AICPA’s Trust Services Criteria (TSC) serve as the benchmark for evaluating whether an entity’s cybersecurity controls are suitably designed and operating effectively. While the TSC framework was initially developed for evaluating controls over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy (often used in SOC 2 engagements), these principles can be adapted for cybersecurity-specific objectives.

Below is an example of how the TSC may map to cybersecurity considerations:

• Logical Access and Authentication Controls  
  – Ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can access critical resources.  
• Incident Response  
  – Addresses the organization’s ability to detect, respond, and recover from cyberattacks or security incidents.  
• Risk Management and Assessment  
  – Outlines the processes for identifying potential threats and determining how to treat or mitigate those risks.  
• Physical Security  
  – Focuses on restricting physical access to data centers, servers, and other infrastructure.  
• Change Management  
  – Ensures that changes to applications, infrastructure, and security policies are tested and implemented securely.

CPAs conducting a SOC for Cybersecurity examination use the TSC to assess whether each control is relevant to the cybersecurity objectives, properly designed, and proven to operate effectively over a specified period.

### 4. Reporting on SOC for Cybersecurity

Unlike certain SOC reports restricted to specific audiences (e.g., SOC 2 reports restricted to service organization management and relevant users), SOC for Cybersecurity reports can be issued in a format suitable for either an internal or general audience. Typically, these reports contain:

1. **Management’s Description** of the cybersecurity risk management program, prepared against the Description Criteria.  
2. **Management’s Assertion** stating that the description properly represents their cybersecurity program and that the controls within the description are suitably designed and operating effectively.  
3. **Practitioner’s Opinion** providing an independent assessment of the fairness of the description and the design and operating effectiveness of controls.

Depending on the intended audience, organizations might choose a detailed report for internal stakeholders or a more concise, high-level report for external stakeholders (e.g., prospective clients, investors, or regulators) who need assurance about the entity’s overall cybersecurity readiness.

### 5. Practical Examples and Case Studies

Below are some real-world examples illustrating how organizations benefit from SOC for Cybersecurity examinations:

1. **Financial Institutions**  
   – Banks subject to stringent cybersecurity regulations can use SOC for Cybersecurity to demonstrate compliance and readiness to protect sensitive customer data.  
2. **Healthcare Providers**  
   – Hospital networks can reassure patients and insurers that personal health information is secured through robust cybersecurity measures.  
3. **Retail Companies**  
   – Large retail chains facing multiple points of sale (POS) vulnerabilities can assure customers and partners that credit card and transaction data is safeguarded.

These organizations often face unique threats and regulatory requirements, highlighting how SOC for Cybersecurity can be adapted to a variety of operational contexts.
