## 17.3 Compliance Attestation and Other Special Reports

In today’s complex regulatory environment, many organizations must demonstrate compliance with specific laws, regulations, contractual clauses, or grant provisions. Public and private entities alike rely on external auditors—often Certified Public Accountants (CPAs)—to perform attestation engagements that validate adherence to these requirements. Thus, compliance attestation is a vital service, especially for entities that must assure stakeholders, creditors, and regulators of their commitment to lawful and contractual obligations.

This section explores the fundamental objectives of compliance attestation engagements, outlines the procedural steps an auditor typically takes, and describes the unique reporting requirements and potential pitfalls in these engagements. The discussion here serves as a reference for CPA candidates preparing for the Auditing and Attestation (AUD) section, as well as experienced auditors seeking a deeper understanding of specialized compliance reporting.

## 1. Introduction to Compliance Attestation

Compliance attestation engagements center on evaluating or testing an organization’s conformity with established criteria. These criteria may encompass:

• Federal or state laws and regulations (e.g., environmental standards).  
• Contractual terms or debt covenants (e.g., maintaining specified financial ratios).  
• Grant agreements (e.g., use of funds for allowable costs, stringent documentation requirements).  

Engagements typically follow AT-C Section 315, “Compliance Attestation.” Auditors apply either an examination-level engagement or an agreed-upon procedures (AUP) engagement to assess the entity’s compliance:

1. Examination Engagement:  
   • The CPA expresses an opinion on whether the entity complied, in all material respects, with the stated requirements.  
   • Similar to an audit, the practitioner gathers evidence, conducts tests, and issues a report with positive assurance.  

2. Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement:  
   • The CPA performs specific procedures agreed upon by the engaging party and other specified users (e.g., lender, regulatory body).  
   • The CPA does not provide an opinion, but rather reports findings based on the procedures performed (often stated as “We found no exceptions in applying the specified procedures”).  

---

## 2. Identifying Criteria for Compliance

The foundation of a compliance attestation engagement is a clear and well-defined set of criteria. Common sources of compliance criteria include:

• Regulatory Requirements: For instance, a manufacturing plant may need to prove compliance with emission limits set by an environmental protection agency.  
• Contractual Agreements: Lenders often impose debt covenants such as minimum current ratios or maximum debt-to-equity ratios. Violation of these covenants could trigger penalties or default clauses.  
• Grant Provisions: Government or private grants may stipulate how funds can be spent, recorded, and reported, along with documentation requirements.  

The auditor must ensure that these criteria are suitable, objective, measurable, complete, and relevant to the entity’s operations. The ability to measure or evaluate compliance hinges on the clarity and consistency of the underlying requirements.

## 3. Evidence Gathering and Testing Procedures

The scope and nature of testing vary depending on whether it is an examination or an agreed-upon procedures engagement. Typical steps include:

### 3.1 Planning the Engagement

• Understand the entity’s operations, internal controls, and risk environment.  
• Determine engagement scope in line with the needs of the intended users of the report (e.g., the board of directors, regulators, or lending institutions).  
• Discuss and document expectations about the engagement, including the form of the final report.  

### 3.2 Assessing Internal Controls Over Compliance

• Evaluate the design and implementation of controls intended to ensure compliance with specified requirements.  
• Identify key control activities (approval workflows, oversight committees, training programs) that mitigate compliance risks.  
• Consider the control environment's “tone at the top” and how it influences compliance efforts.

### 3.3 Performing Test Procedures

• Inspection of Documentation: Review evidence such as purchase invoices, payroll records, or environmental tests to verify compliance.  
• Observation: Observe processes related to compliance (e.g., verifying safe disposal of hazardous waste).  
• Confirmation: Seek direct confirmations from third parties (e.g., regulators, lenders) regarding compliance status.  
• Recalculation: Validate calculations used in determining compliance with debt covenants or other numeric thresholds.  
• Reperformance: Re-perform control activities to test their effectiveness (e.g., verify that an internal approval process was correctly followed).

### 3.4 Evaluating Evidence and Drawing Conclusions

• Compare test results against the identified criteria.  
• Document and evaluate any deviations or instances of noncompliance found.  
• Consider materiality in determining whether noncompliance is significant enough to affect the overall engagement conclusion.

## 4. Reporting Requirements

Reporting in compliance attestation engagements differs slightly depending on whether the engagement is an examination or agreed-upon procedures:

### 4.1 Examination Engagement Reports

• Opinion Paragraph: The CPA offers an opinion on whether the entity complied, in all material respects, with the specified requirements.  
• Basis for Opinion: Clarifies the nature of the engagement, level of assurance, and the professional standards followed (AT-C 315).  
• Scope Paragraph: Describes the procedures performed and acknowledges that they provide reasonable assurance (but not absolute) of detecting material noncompliance.  

### 4.2 Agreed-Upon Procedures Reports

• Procedures and Findings: A table or narrative describing each agreed-upon procedure and the corresponding results, including any deviations or exceptions.  
• Disclaimer of Opinion: Because an AUP engagement is not designed for an overall opinion, the report explicitly states that no opinion is provided.  
• Intended Use: States that the report is only for the specified parties, given that procedures were developed for their specific needs.

### 4.3 Additional Disclosures

• Limitations on the Scope: The CPA may highlight restrictions imposed by the client or inherent limitations in testing compliance.  
• Inherent Uncertainty: Certain compliance requirements may be subject to interpretations that evolve over time.

## 5. Practical Example: Debt Covenant Compliance

Consider a mid-sized manufacturing firm that must maintain a maximum debt-to-equity ratio as specified in its loan agreement with a bank. Should the ratio exceed the agreed limit, the bank has the right to recall the loan or impose higher interest rates.

• Criteria: The debt covenant clause from the loan agreement, which might read: “Debt-to-equity ratio shall not exceed 2.5:1 at any quarter-end.”  
• Procedures:  
  1. Recalculate the debt-to-equity ratio using the entity’s balance sheet.  
  2. Inspect supporting reports for any off-balance-sheet liabilities or capital injections.  
  3. Inspect the general ledger and confirm that the entity correctly classified liabilities and equity.  
• Conclusion: Issue either a clear opinion or a findings report, stating whether the entity remained within the threshold. If the ratio was 2.4:1, the entity is in compliance. If it was 2.7:1, it would be deemed noncompliant.

## 7. Special Considerations and Common Pitfalls

1. Materiality in Compliance: Defining materiality can be tricky, as even minor infractions may carry significant regulatory consequences.  
2. Cumulative Noncompliance: Multiple isolated incidents could collectively become material.  
3. Legal Interpretations: Some regulations may be open to interpretation, so auditors should seek legal counsel when substantial ambiguity exists.  
4. Independence Threats: Perform compliance attestation engagements with heightened awareness of independence requirements. Avoid advocacy threats or self-review threats, especially if the CPA also provided advisory or consulting services to develop the policies in question.  
5. Documentation: Thoroughly document the reasoning behind the selection of procedures, evidence obtained, and conclusions reached. Proper documentation is crucial for peer reviews, PCAOB inspections, or disciplinary proceedings.

- [ ] Negative assurance on the entity’s compliance.  
- [x] Positive assurance on the entity’s compliance.  
- [ ] Zero assurance and strictly reports procedures performed.

> **Explanation:** An examination-level compliance engagement provides positive (reasonable) assurance regarding the entity’s adherence to specified requirements, as stated in AT-C Section 315.

### Which of the following is most likely a criterion in a compliance attestation engagement?
- [ ] Company mission statements.  
- [x] Debt covenant provisions stating a maximum debt-to-equity ratio.

> **Explanation:** In AUP engagements, the CPA only states factual findings and does not express an overall opinion, limiting the report’s users to agreed-upon parties.

### A primary difference between an examination and an agreed-upon procedures engagement in compliance is:
- [x] The level of assurance provided.  
- [ ] The number of working papers required.  
- [ ] That the AUP engagement provides more extensive testing.  
- [ ] That an examination is generally less costly for clients.

> **Explanation:** The most significant distinction is the form and extent of assurance provided—an examination yields a reasonable assurance opinion, while an AUP only presents findings from specified procedures.

### Which organization’s standards primarily govern compliance attestation engagements in the United States?
- [ ] PCAOB  
- [x] AICPA  
- [ ] SEC  
- [ ] FASB

> **Explanation:** The AICPA’s AT-C Section 315 sets the professional standards for compliance attestation.  

### When determining materiality for compliance engagements:
- [x] Noncompliance that might influence decisions of intended users is considered material.  
- [ ] Any technical breach is deemed immaterial if monetary amounts are small.  
- [ ] Materiality is not relevant to compliance engagements.  
- [ ] Only instances above $100,000 are considered material.

> **Explanation:** Materiality in compliance engagements is determined by the potential impact on users’ decisions, not strictly by quantitative thresholds.

### When performing compliance attestation on a government grant:
- [x] The auditor verifies expenditures against grant provisions and checks for appropriate documentation.  
- [ ] The auditor only issues a disclaimer of opinion.  
- [ ] The auditor relies exclusively on the Single Audit Act.  
- [ ] The auditor is not permitted to verify any financial expenditures.

> **Explanation:** In a compliance engagement involving government grants, verifying whether funds have been spent in accordance with rule-based restrictions is a key procedure, referencing the relevant laws and grant terms.

### Which is most important for properly identifying compliance criteria?
- [ ] Broad mission statements of the organization.  
- [ ] Unwritten operational policies.  
- [x] Official documents such as regulations, contracts, or grant agreements.
