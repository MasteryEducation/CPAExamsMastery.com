## 19.4 Reporting and Disclosures in EBP Audits

Employee Benefit Plan (EBP) audits involve specific reporting requirements and detailed disclosures designed to address the Department of Labor (DOL), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and participant needs. These requirements can vary based on the nature of the plan—defined contribution, defined benefit, health and welfare plans, or employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)—but certain fundamentals remain consistent. This section explores the required financial statements, supplemental schedules, and the nuances of the auditor’s opinion for EBP engagements.

---

### 1. Financial Statements Format

The typical financial statements required for an EBP audit encompass:

1. Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits  
2. Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits  
3. Relevant footnotes, including detailed disclosures regarding plan provisions, investment valuation policies, party-in-interest transactions, and plan obligations for defined benefit plans.

For defined benefit pension plans, actuarial information also needs to be presented, such as changes in plan obligations and the plan’s funded status. These disclosures ensure transparency about the plan’s health and ability to meet future obligations to participants.

#### 1.1 Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits

This statement provides a snapshot of the plan’s fiduciary net position as of the end of the plan year. It commonly lists:

• Investments: Equity and debt securities, real estate, mutual funds, and other investments.  
• Participant loans: Loans extended to participants from their vested plan balances.  
• Receivables: Contributions owed to the plan but not yet received.  
• Liabilities: Payables or short-term obligations, if any, at the plan level.

The Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits may also detail separate classes or types of investments for clarity, such as segregating equity mutual funds from fixed-income mutual funds. Some plans elect to further break out investments by major categories or strategies to illustrate diversification.

#### 1.2 Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits

In this statement, the plan discloses:

• Contributions: Participant and employer contributions, including both cash contributions and any non-cash contributions of securities.  
• Investment income (loss): Interest, dividends, and realized/unrealized gains or losses.  
• Benefit payments and withdrawals: Payments to participants during the plan year, including lump sum distributions, scheduled payouts, or hardship withdrawals.  
• Administrative expenses: Fees for investment management, recordkeeping, or legal services.  

This statement reveals how the plan’s resources increased or decreased over the reporting period, highlighting the net effect of contributions, investment performance, and benefit payouts.

#### 1.3 Actuarial Disclosures (Defined Benefit Plans)

Defined benefit plans must include additional information pertaining to the present value of accumulated benefits and funded status. This often involves presenting:

• Actuarial assumptions (e.g., discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets).  
• Changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO) over the period.  
• The plan’s funding level and any underfunded or overfunded status.  

These disclosures illuminate the plan’s ability to meet future obligations to participants and reveal the financial risks associated with the plan’s funding.

### 2. Supplemental Schedules

Under the Department of Labor (DOL) and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulations, certain schedules must accompany the plan’s Form 5500 filing (or be attached to the financial statements used for the audit). Key supplemental schedules include:

1. Schedule of Assets Held at End of Year  
2. Schedule of Reportable Transactions  
3. Schedule of Nonexempt Transactions (if applicable)  

These schedules offer transparency regarding the plan’s transactions and investment holdings. For example:

• The Schedule of Assets Held at End of Year discloses each investment, including cost basis if required, and helps regulators and participants understand the diversification or concentration risks within the plan.  
• The Schedule of Reportable Transactions summarizes large or frequent transactions, highlighting any potential self-dealing or conflicts of interest.  
• The auditor’s report will refer to whether these supplemental schedules were subjected to auditing procedures or were part of a limited-scope audit.

#### 2.1 Schedule of Assets Held at End of Year Example

Below is a simplified representation of a Schedule of Assets Held at End of Year, indicating the investment categories and fair values at year-end.

    A[Schedule of Assets Held <br> at End of Year] --> B[List of Investments <br> (Mutual Funds, Stocks, Bonds)]
    B --> C[Description and <br> Identifying Information]
    B --> D[Fair Value<br> at Year-End]
    B --> E[Cost or Basis<br>(if required)]
```

In practical terms, each line item may also include details such as CUSIP numbers, maturity dates (for bonds), and other descriptors to ensure completeness and traceability.

### 3. Auditor’s Opinion

In EBP audits, the nature of the engagement can differ based on the extent of auditor responsibility for investment information. Two primary types of opinions exist:

1. **Full-Scope Audit**  
   In a full-scope EBP audit, the auditor examines all plan investments, contributions, benefit payments, and other financial information. The auditor expresses an opinion on whether the financial statements, in all material respects, present the plan’s financial status and changes in net assets available for benefits.

2. **Limited-Scope Audit**  
   Under ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C), a plan administrator may elect to exclude from the audit certain investment information if a qualified institution (e.g., a bank or insurance carrier) certifies the completeness and accuracy of that information. In this scenario, the auditor’s opinion disclaims responsibility for the certified investment portion of the financial statements and expresses a limited-scope opinion on the remaining financial statement components.

#### 3.1 Full-Scope Audit Report Example

In a full-scope audit, the opinion often reads as an unmodified (or “clean”) opinion if no material misstatements or compliance issues are identified. The auditor’s report explicitly states that the financial statements “present fairly, in all material respects,” the net assets and changes in net assets available for benefits, in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

#### 3.2 Limited-Scope Audit Report Nuances

In a limited-scope audit report, the auditor may issue the following:

• A disclaimer of opinion on the portion of the financial statements relating to the certified investment information.  
• An opinion (often unmodified) on the remaining aspects of the plan’s financial statements that are within the auditor’s scope.  

The auditor’s report clearly identifies the limitation imposed by management’s election under ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C) and references the certification provided by the qualified institution.

### 4. Footnotes and Disclosures

Footnote disclosures for EBPs can be extensive, covering areas such as:

1. **Plan Description**  
   Details about plan provisions, eligibility requirements, vesting schedules, and benefit terms.  
2. **Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**  
   Discusses the basis of accounting, investment valuation methods, and recognition of contributions or benefit payments.  
3. **Party-in-Interest Transactions**  
   Any transactions involving parties who may have a relationship with the plan, such as the plan sponsor, fiduciaries, or investment managers.  
4. **Commitments and Contingencies**  
   Potential liabilities or pending litigation related to the plan.  
5. **Tax Status**  
   IRS qualification status, including reference to the plan’s determination letter or reliance on prototype plan letters.

Clear and comprehensive footnotes help participants, regulators, and other stakeholders understand the financial position and operational risks of the plan.

### 5. Common Issues, Best Practices, and Pitfalls

Auditors and plan administrators need to address several challenges when preparing and reviewing EBP audits:

• **Timely and Complete Documentation**: Gathering participant data, investment statements, and contribution records can be complex. Early planning and a sound internal control environment help mitigate complications.  
• **Valuation of Hard-to-Value Investments**: Plans may hold illiquid assets, such as real estate or privately held securities. Auditor procedures must ensure that valuations are reasonable.  
• **Compliance with DOL Requirements**: Failure to properly include the required supplemental schedules or adequately disclose prohibited transactions may result in DOL sanctions or rework of filed documents.  
• **Limited-Scope vs. Full-Scope Engagement**: Ensuring consistency between the scope, the certification, and the final auditor’s report is critical to avoid confusion or misstatement.  
• **Monitoring Subsequent Events**: Benefit plan changes, purchases or sales of significant assets, or litigation arising after the balance sheet date should be considered for proper disclosure.

### 6. Practical Example and Insights

Consider a mid-sized manufacturing company sponsoring a 401(k) plan. Near year-end, the company acquired a new division, resulting in an influx of participants. This situation increases the risk of errors in participant contribution eligibility and enrollment. During the EBP audit:

1. The auditor verifies that the plan sponsor has accurately captured new participants’ contributions and updates to vested balances.  
2. Investments in mutual funds are confirmed with the custodian’s statements and verified against the plan’s own records.  
3. Any plan acquisitions or mergers are disclosed in the footnotes, detailing newly covered participants and how their past service has been treated regarding vesting credit.

Such real-world scenarios underscore the importance of thorough planning, validation of data, and proper presentation of all relevant financial and operational events in the EBP’s financial statements.
