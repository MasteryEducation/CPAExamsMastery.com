## C.1 Purpose and Structure of Illustrative Reports

When auditors complete their examination of an entity’s financial statements, they communicate the results to Financial Statement Users (FSUs) through an auditor’s report. This report, often referred to as the audit opinion, follows a structured and standardized format to ensure clarity, comparability, and completeness. By understanding the purpose and structure of illustrative auditor’s reports, candidates for the CPA Exam, as well as professionals and students, can more effectively recognize how different opinion types are formed, the impact of emphasis-of-matter paragraphs, and the way unusual circumstances are addressed in the final communication to stakeholders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Introduction to Auditor’s Reports

The overall aim of the auditor’s report is to provide an independent assessment of whether the entity’s financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework (e.g., U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles [GAAP]). This independent evaluation helps strengthen the credibility of financial information used by external parties such as investors, creditors, regulators, and the general public. 

To achieve this objective, auditors must follow generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS), which include guidelines from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and, in certain contexts, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) for issuers (public companies). 

#### Why Are Illustrative Reports Important?
1. They serve as a template for structuring final auditor communications.
2. They ensure consistency and clarity by following a prescribed layout.
3. They incorporate requirements for special disclosures or paragraphs, such as emphasis-of-matter or other-matter paragraphs, when unusual circumstances arise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Key Elements of an Auditor’s Report

Though different standards exist for nonissuers (AU-C Section 700) and issuers (PCAOB AS 3101), the major components generally remain consistent. Below is a mermaid diagram illustrating the typical structure of a standard auditor’s report:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Title] --> B[Addressee]
    B --> C[Opinion Section]
    C --> D[Basis for Opinion]
    D --> E[Responsibilities of Management]
    E --> F[Auditor’s Responsibilities]
    F --> G[Signature, Address, Date]
```

Let’s examine each component:

1. **Title**  
   • Clarifies that it is an independent auditor’s report (e.g., “Independent Auditor’s Report”).

2. **Addressee**  
   • Typically addressed to the board of directors or shareholders, depending on the specific requirement.

3. **Opinion Section**  
   • States the auditor’s conclusion on whether the financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with the applicable financial framework.  
   • For nonissuers, a “clean” opinion is termed an “Unmodified Opinion,” whereas for issuers, it is called an “Unqualified Opinion.”  

4. **Basis for Opinion Paragraph**  
   • Explains the standards under which the audit was conducted (GAAS for nonissuers or PCAOB standards for issuers).  
   • Confirms that the auditor obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for opinion.  
   • Discloses auditor independence and ethical obligations, in accordance with AICPA, PCAOB, SEC, or other relevant bodies.

5. **Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  
   • Specifies that management is responsible for preparing and fairly presenting the financial statements and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal controls.

6. **Auditor’s Responsibilities**  
   • Highlights the auditor’s role in planning and performing the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.  
   • References professional skepticism and the necessity of professional judgment throughout the audit.  

7. **Signature, Address, and Date**  
   • Typically includes the printed or signed name of the engagement partner or firm (depending on jurisdiction), the auditor’s address, and the date the report is issued.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Types of Opinions Delivered in Illustrative Reports

#### 3.1 Unmodified vs. Unqualified Opinion

• **Unmodified Opinion (Nonissuers)**:  
  - Issued when the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  
  - References AU-C Section 700, Forming an Opinion and Reporting on Financial Statements.  
  - Often referred to colloquially as a “clean” opinion.  

• **Unqualified Opinion (Issuers)**:  
  - Issued when the financial statements, in all material respects, conform with the applicable financial reporting framework.  
  - PCAOB AS 3101 prescribes language specific to public companies, including a discussion of the auditor’s basis for opinion and critical audit matters (CAMs), if applicable.

#### 3.2 Qualified Opinion

• **Reason for Issuance**:  
  - A qualified opinion arises when the auditor concludes that misstatements are material but not pervasive, or if the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence on a particular matter (i.e., a scope limitation), yet this limitation affects only a specific area of the financial statements.  

• **Structure in the Report**:  
  - Modifications to the Opinion Section specify “except for” or “with the exception of” describing the misstatement or limitation.  
  - The Basis for Opinion Paragraph elaborates on the nature of the qualification.

#### 3.3 Adverse Opinion

• **Reason for Issuance**:  
  - Issued if misstatements are both material and pervasive. In this situation, the financial statements do not present the entity’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows fairly.  

• **Report Structure**:  
  - The Opinion Section explicitly states that the financial statements are not presented fairly.  
  - The Basis for Opinion Paragraph thoroughly describes the nature of the misstatements.

#### 3.4 Disclaimer of Opinion

• **Reason for Issuance**:  
  - Occurs when the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to form an opinion, and the possible effects of undetected misstatements could be both material and pervasive.  
  - Can also result from significant uncertainties or auditor association with unaudited financial statements.  

• **Report Structure**:  
  - The Opinion Section indicates that the auditor does not express an opinion on the financial statements.  
  - Basis for Opinion describes the limitation or reason preventing an audit conclusion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Use of Emphasis-of-Matter and Other-Matter Paragraphs

Even within an unmodified or unqualified opinion, special circumstances can prompt the addition of emphasis-of-matter paragraphs in the auditor’s report. These paragraphs draw readers’ attention to matters already disclosed in the financial statements that are fundamental to understanding those statements (e.g., going concern uncertainties, significant accounting policy changes, or subsequent events).

• **Emphasis-of-Matter Paragraph**:  
  - Appears immediately after the Opinion Section and references the note in the financial statements.  
  - Does not modify the auditor’s overall opinion.  

• **Other-Matter Paragraph**:  
  - Refers to matters not disclosed in the financial statements themselves but relevant for user understanding, such as an explanation of auditor responsibilities in the prior year’s audit if a predecessor auditor reported differently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Consistency in Structure for Clarity

Consistency in the structure and language of auditor’s reports ensures readers can readily identify pertinent information. Reports typically include consistent headings, a clearly labeled “Opinion,” a “Basis for Opinion,” and reference to any modifications or additional paragraphs.

| Section                    | Purpose                                                                        | Key Factor                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Title                     | Identifies the document as prepared by an independent auditor                  | Must reference “Independent Auditor’s Report” |
| Addressee                 | States who is receiving the report                                             | Usually shareholders or the Board of Directors  |
| Opinion Section           | Communicates the overall conclusion on the financial statements                | Specifies if unmodified, unqualified, or modified |
| Basis for Opinion         | Explains the standards applied and ensures the reader of sufficient evidence   | Details the professional standards used           |
| Responsibilities          | Outlines the roles of management and auditor                                   | Reinforces that management is primarily responsible for the F/S |
| Emphasis-of-Matter        | Highlights significant issues already disclosed in the F/S                     | Must link to specific note disclosures          |
| Other-Matter              | Covers issues not included in the F/S but relevant to users                    | Often used for prior-year auditor change, etc. |
| Signature & Date          | Finalizes and authenticates the report                                         | Auditor or firm signs and dates the report    |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Common Report Modifications and Wordings

Auditors often rely on sample or illustrative language published by the AICPA and other professional organizations to ensure their reports comply with auditing standards. Such resources include:

- **AICPA “Audit and Accounting Manual”**: Contains sample opinions for various situations (unmodified, emphasis-of-matter, special purpose frameworks).  
- **PCAOB Example Integrated Audit Reports**: Useful for understanding how to combine a report on financial statements with a report on internal control over financial reporting for issuers.  

When referencing these samples, auditors adapt the wording to the entity’s unique circumstances, ensuring consistency with professional requirements and the financial reporting framework.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Practical Considerations

1. **Going Concern**: If significant doubt exists about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, an emphasis-of-matter paragraph should be added to highlight management’s disclosures.  
2. **Changes in Accounting Principles**: Any material changes that affect comparability from one period to another can prompt an emphasis-of-matter paragraph referencing the note description.  
3. **Comparative Financial Statements**: When financial statements of a prior period are audited by a different auditor, reference to the predecessor auditor’s opinion or reissuance of that report must be clearly communicated.  
4. **Other Accompanying Information**: If the audited financial statements are published alongside additional data (e.g., management’s discussion, supplementary schedules), the auditor’s responsibilities regarding such information should be clarified in the other-matter or separate sections.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. References and Suggested Resources

• **AICPA Audit and Accounting Manual**  
  Provides comprehensive examples of different types of opinions for nonissuers, including emphasis-of-matter paragraphs and other specialized reporting scenarios.

• **PCAOB Standards, Including AS 3101**  
  Offers insight into reporting standards for issuers, critical audit matters (CAMs), and integrated audits of financial statements and internal control over financial reporting.

• **CPAReview Frameworks (Becker, Gleim, etc.)**  
  These review courses provide practice sets and simulations with sample language that helps clarify how reports adjust for specific circumstances like scope limitations or adverse findings.

• **Official GAAS Guide**  
  The AICPA’s Professional Standards, available online, maintain the authoritative text for AU-C Sections addressing the formation of audit opinions and modifications.

> **Explanation:** The auditor’s report is intended to offer an independent opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements, in all material respects, according to the applicable financial reporting framework.

### What is an Unmodified Opinion referred to in the context of public company (issuer) audits?
- [ ] Disclaimer of Opinion
- [x] Unqualified Opinion
- [ ] Qualified Opinion
- [ ] Adverse Opinion

> **Explanation:** For issuers, a “clean” opinion is usually called an Unqualified Opinion under PCAOB standards, whereas it is referred to as an Unmodified Opinion for nonissuers under AICPA standards.

### Under which circumstances would an Emphasis-of-Matter paragraph be most appropriate?
- [x] Highlighting significant uncertainties disclosed in the financial statements.
- [ ] Suggesting modifications to management’s footnotes.
- [ ] Overriding the auditor’s opinion entirely.
- [x] Both A) and D) are correct.

> **Explanation:** Emphasis-of-Matter paragraphs draw attention to significant issues already disclosed in the financial statements, such as going concern or change in accounting principle.

### What is the main difference between Emphasis-of-Matter and Other-Matter paragraphs?
- [x] Emphasis-of-Matter draws attention to items disclosed in the F/S, while Other-Matter addresses items not disclosed in the F/S.
- [ ] Other-Matter replaces the Opinion Paragraph in modifications.
- [ ] Emphasis-of-Matter only appears in adverse opinions.
- [ ] They are always used interchangeably.

> **Explanation:** Emphasis-of-Matter paragraphs refer to matters disclosed in the financial statements that are fundamental to users’ understanding. Other-Matter paragraphs address items not included in the F/S but relevant to users.

### What happens when the auditor lacks sufficient appropriate evidence for a particular area of the financial statements, and such limitation is material and pervasive?
- [ ] A Qualified Opinion is expressed.
- [ ] A basis for an Unmodified Opinion is formed.
- [ ] An Emphasis-of-Matter paragraph requires placement.
- [x] A Disclaimer of Opinion is issued.

> **Explanation:** If the auditor cannot obtain enough appropriate evidence and the possible effects of undetected misstatements are material and pervasive, the auditor must disclaim an opinion.

### In an audited report of a nonissuer, where should an Emphasis-of-Matter paragraph be placed?
- [ ] After the responsibilities of management section
- [ ] Immediately before the Opinion Paragraph
- [x] Immediately after the Opinion Paragraph
- [ ] Only in a footnote

> **Explanation:** According to AU-C Section 706, an Emphasis-of-Matter paragraph follows the Opinion Paragraph and before any Other-Matter paragraph.

### If there is a significant going concern uncertainty, but management adequately discloses it in the notes to the financial statements, the auditor should:
- [x] Issue an unmodified (nonissuer) or unqualified (issuer) opinion with an Emphasis-of-Matter paragraph.
- [ ] Withhold their report until the uncertainty is resolved.
- [ ] Issue an Adverse Opinion.
- [ ] Increase detailed testing and remove the note disclosure.

> **Explanation:** As long as the disclosures are adequate, the auditor typically issues a clean opinion along with an Emphasis-of-Matter paragraph highlighting the going concern issue.

### True or False: A nonissuer’s “Unmodified Opinion” and an issuer’s “Unqualified Opinion” both represent a “clean” opinion under GAAP.
- [x] True
- [ ] False

> **Explanation:** Although the terminology differs (unmodified for nonissuers vs. unqualified for issuers), both opinions reflect that the financial statements are free of material misstatements.
