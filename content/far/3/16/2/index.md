## 16.2 Recognition, Measurement (Discounts/Premiums), Amortization Methods

In this chapter, we explore the critical aspects of debt recognition and subsequent measurement under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We discuss how to account for financial liabilities—especially bonds—issued at face value, discount, or premium, and how carrying values change over time using various amortization methods (primarily the straight-line method and the effective interest method). Proper understanding of these concepts is paramount to accurate financial reporting and to confidently tackle the Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR) section of the CPA exam.

This section covers:

• Recognition and Initial Measurement of Debt  
• Accounting for Bond Discounts and Premiums  
• Amortization Methods (Straight-Line and Effective Interest)  
• Carrying Value Adjustments Over Time  
• Redemption or Retirement of Debt  
• Practical Examples and Case Studies  

Consistent and precise debt accounting ensures transparency and reliability in financial statements, instilling trust among investors, creditors, and other stakeholders.

### Overview of Recognition and Measurement

When an entity issues debt instruments such as bonds, it must determine how to record (recognize) and measure them initially. Under FASB ASC 470 (Debt) and related guidance, a liability is recorded at the proceeds received upon issuance (i.e., generally fair value), which might differ from the face value (par) of the bond. The difference between the proceeds received and the bond’s face amount can be a discount or a premium:

• A discount arises when the bond’s stated interest rate (or coupon rate) is lower than the market (yield) rate of interest, causing proceeds to fall below the bond’s face value.  
• A premium arises when the bond’s stated interest rate exceeds the market rate, causing proceeds to exceed the bond’s face value.  

#### Key Terminology

• Face Value (Par Value, Maturity Value): The amount payable at maturity.  
• Coupon (Stated) Rate: The periodic interest rate used to determine cash interest payments to bondholders.  
• Market (Yield) Rate: The interest rate at which investors are willing to purchase the bond. This rate influences the bond’s original issue price.  
• Bond Carrying Amount (Book Value): The net amount at which the bond is reported in the issuer’s balance sheet. It is equal to the bond’s face value plus any unamortized premium or minus any unamortized discount.  

---

### Bond Discounts and Premiums

#### Bond Issued at a Discount

A bond is issued at a discount if the stated interest rate on the bond is less than the prevailing market rate for similar debt instruments. The issuer receives an amount (the issuance proceeds) that is less than the bond’s face value. Over the life of the bond, the discount is amortized to interest expense, resulting in an increasing carrying value, ultimately converging with the face value at maturity.

##### Example

• Face value of the bond: \$100,000  
• Stated annual coupon rate: 6%  
• Market (yield) rate: 7%  
• Issue price: \$95,900 (implied discount of \$4,100)

In this scenario, the bond proceeds are less than the face value, creating a discount that will be amortized.

#### Bond Issued at a Premium

A bond is issued at a premium if its stated interest rate is higher than the market rate. The proceeds exceed the face value, creating a premium. Over the bond’s life, the premium is amortized to reduce interest expense, and the bond’s carrying amount decreases until it equals the face value at maturity.

##### Example

• Face value of the bond: \$100,000  
• Stated annual coupon rate: 8%  
• Market (yield) rate: 7%  
• Issue price: \$104,200 (implied premium of \$4,200)

The premium is systematically recognized (amortized) over time, lowering the bond’s carrying value from \$104,200 to \$100,000 at maturity.

---

### Amortization Methods

U.S. GAAP allows two primary methods for amortizing discounts and premiums:

• Straight-Line Method  
• Effective Interest Method  

However, the effective interest method is the preferred method under ASC 835 (Interest) because it better reflects the economic reality of how interest is incurred over time. The straight-line method, although simpler, might not precisely match expense recognition with the passage of time unless the results are not materially different from the effective interest method.

#### Straight-Line Method

Under the straight-line method, the total amount of discount or premium is allocated evenly over the bond’s term. Each period, the issuer records a constant amount of discount (or premium) amortization against interest expense, regardless of the bond’s carrying amount. If the bond matures or is callable before the scheduled maturity, unamortized discount or premium may have to be recognized at once.

##### Journal Entries: Straight-Line Amortization of Discount

Example: A \$4,000 discount over 4 years. Annual amortization = \$1,000.

• At issuance:
  - Debit Cash for issuance proceeds  
  - Debit Discount on Bonds Payable for \$4,000  
  - Credit Bonds Payable for the face amount  

• Each interest payment period:
  - Debit Interest Expense (Coupon + Discount Amortization)  
  - Credit Discount on Bonds Payable (for \$1,000)  
  - Credit Cash (for coupon payment)  

##### Journal Entries: Straight-Line Amortization of Premium

Example: A \$4,000 premium over 4 years. Annual amortization = \$1,000.

• At issuance:
  - Debit Cash for issuance proceeds  
  - Credit Premium on Bonds Payable for \$4,000  
  - Credit Bonds Payable for the face amount  

• Each interest payment period:
  - Debit Interest Expense (Coupon – Premium Amortization)  
  - Debit Premium on Bonds Payable (for \$1,000)  
  - Credit Cash (for coupon payment)  

---

#### Effective Interest Method

Under the effective interest method (sometimes called the “interest method”), the periodic interest expense is determined using the bond’s carrying value at the beginning of the period multiplied by the yield (market) rate in effect at issuance. This method results in a varying amortization amount each period, but ensures the interest rate recognized is constant over the bond’s life in terms of yield.

##### Basic Formula

If C₀ is the carrying value at the beginning of the period, and r is the market yield (on a per-period basis), then:

Interest Expense = C₀ × r

For a discount:
• Amortization of Discount = Interest Expense – Cash Interest Paid  

For a premium:
• Amortization of Premium = Cash Interest Paid – Interest Expense  

##### Example Calculation

Assume:
• Face value = \$100,000  
• Coupon = 6% annually, paid once a year  
• Yield (market) rate = 7% annually  
• Term = 5 years  
• Issue price = \$95,842 (implying a discount of \$4,158)

Year 1:

• Beginning carrying amount: \$95,842  
• Interest expense: \$95,842 × 7% = \$6,709 (approx.)  
• Cash interest paid: \$100,000 × 6% = \$6,000  
• Discount amortization: \$6,709 – \$6,000 = \$709  
• Ending carrying amount: \$95,842 + \$709 = \$96,551  

Year 2:

• Beginning carrying amount: \$96,551  
• Interest expense: \$96,551 × 7% = \$6,759 (approx.)  
• Cash interest paid: \$6,000  
• Discount amortization: \$6,759 – \$6,000 = \$759  
• Ending carrying amount: \$96,551 + \$759 = \$97,310  

And so on, until the carrying amount reaches the face value of \$100,000 at maturity.

Below is a simplified visualization of how the carrying amount gradually converges to face value:

### Carrying Value Adjustments Over Time

The carrying value of a bond changes each period because of the amortization of the discount or premium. Under the:

• Straight-line method, the discount or premium amortization is the same each period, resulting in a consistent change to carrying value.  
• Effective interest method, the discount or premium amortization grows or shrinks each period, depending on the bond’s carrying amount at the beginning of each period.  

By the maturity date, the bond’s carrying value always converges to the face (par) value, regardless of whether it was issued at a discount or a premium.

---

### Redemption or Retirement of Debt

Debt redemption (or retirement) occurs when the issuer repays the outstanding bond principle, either at maturity or earlier through call provisions, open-market buybacks, or other means. Under ASC 470, when bonds are retired early, any difference between the net carrying amount (including unamortized discount/premium) and the cash paid (or the reacquisition price) is recognized in the income statement as a gain or loss.

#### Retirement at Maturity

If a bond is held to maturity, its carrying amount will equal the face value. Upon redemption, the issuer pays the face value, and there is no gain or loss (assuming no residual unamortized discount or premium). The journal entry typically includes:

• Debit Bonds Payable  
• Credit Cash  

#### Early Extinguishment of Debt

When an issuer redeems or calls the bonds before maturity:

1. The carrying value is the face value of the bonds plus any unamortized premium or minus any unamortized discount.  
2. The reacquisition price is the amount paid to repurchase the bonds, including any call premium, accrued interest, etc.  
3. The difference between the carrying value and the reacquisition price is recognized as a gain (if carrying value > reacquisition price) or a loss (if carrying value < reacquisition price).  

##### Example

An entity calls its \$100,000 bonds at 102 (i.e., 102% of par). The carrying amount at redemption is \$98,000, reflecting unamortized discount. The entity pays \$102,000 to reacquire the bonds:

• Carrying value: \$98,000  
• Reacquisition price: \$102,000  
• Loss on retirement: \$102,000 – \$98,000 = \$4,000  

Journal Entry:

- Debit Bonds Payable \$100,000  
- Debit Loss on Early Extinguishment \$4,000  
- Credit Discount on Bonds Payable \$2,000 (to remove remaining discount)  
- Credit Cash \$102,000  

The difference is recognized as a loss, reducing net income in the period of redemption.

### Practical Examples and Case Studies

#### Example: Bond Issued at Discount, Effective Interest Amortization

Company A issues a 5-year, \$500,000 face value bond with a 5% stated rate, interest payable annually. Market rate is 6%. The bond sells at \$480,600, implying a \$19,400 discount. Using the effective interest method:

1. Calculate the interest expense each period (carrying value × 6%).  
2. Compute the difference between the cash payment (5% × \$500,000 = \$25,000) and interest expense to arrive at the discount amortization.  
3. Update carrying value each period by adding the amortized discount.  

The discount amortization amounts typically increase as the carrying value grows.

#### Example: Premium, Straight-Line Amortization

Company B issues a 3-year, \$200,000 face value bond at 8% coupon with a stated annual interest. If the market rate is 7%, the bond might sell for \$205,600, implying a \$5,600 premium. Under straight-line amortization:

• Annual amortization = \$5,600 / 3 years = \$1,867 (approx.).  
• Interest expense each period: = Coupon payment – Premium amortization.  
• The carrying value decreases by \$1,867 each period until it reaches \$200,000 at maturity.

### Common Pitfalls, Best Practices, and Strategies

• Mixing Up Rates: Distinguish carefully between the coupon rate and the yield rate. Use the yield rate for determining periodic interest expense under the effective interest method.  
• Incorrect Period Calculations: If bonds pay interest semiannually, all rates and periods must be adjusted accordingly (e.g., half-year yield, half-year coupon).  
• Failure to Recognize Gains/Losses Correctly: When retiring debt before maturity, do not overlook unamortized discounts or premiums.  
• Overlooking Materiality: Though GAAP prefers the effective interest method, a straight-line approach may be acceptable if the results are not materially different.  
• Segregating Issuance Costs: Under ASC 835, issuance costs are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt and amortized over the term of the debt.

### Diagrams and Tables for Clarification

Below is a simple tabular example for an effective interest method amortization schedule. Assume a \$100,000 bond, 5% coupon, 6% yield, and a 5-year term with annual payments.

| Year | Beg. Carrying Value | Interest Expense (6%) | Coupon Paid (5%) | Amortization  | End. Carrying Value |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 1    | \$95,787            | \$5,747              | \$5,000          | \$747 (Discount)  | \$96,534            |
| 2    | \$96,534            | \$5,792              | \$5,000          | \$792           | \$97,326            |
| 3    | \$97,326            | \$5,840              | \$5,000          | \$840           | \$98,166            |
| 4    | \$98,166            | \$5,890              | \$5,000          | \$890           | \$99,056            |
| 5    | \$99,056            | \$5,943              | \$5,000          | \$943           | \$100,000           |

Note how discount amortization increases each period, and the carrying value converges to \$100,000.

## Master Bond Discounts, Premiums, and Amortization: A Comprehensive CPA Quiz

{{< quizdown >}}

### Which of the following best describes a bond discount?

- [ ] The amount by which the bond’s proceeds exceed its face value.  
- [x] The amount by which the bond’s proceeds are less than its face value.  
- [ ] The difference between the face value and the carrying value, recorded as a credit balance.  
- [ ] The coupon rate on the bond.  

> **Explanation:** A bond discount occurs when the bond’s issuance proceeds are lower than the face value, often due to the lower coupon rate compared to the market rate.

### When using the effective interest method, which interest rate is used to calculate the interest expense?

- [ ] The coupon rate stated on the bond certificate.  
- [ ] The prime rate designated by the Federal Reserve.  
- [x] The yield (market) rate at the time of issuance.  
- [ ] The risk-free rate for U.S. Treasury securities.  

> **Explanation:** The effective interest method uses the yield (market) rate at issuance to determine how much interest expense is recorded each period.

### Under the effective interest method, how is the amortization of a discount calculated in each period?

- [ ] Carrying value at the beginning of the period × coupon rate.  
- [ ] Face value × coupon rate.  
- [x] Interest expense minus the cash interest paid.  
- [ ] Coupon interest plus carrying amount.  

> **Explanation:** For a bond issued at a discount, amortization is the difference between interest expense (computed using the yield rate times the beginning carrying value) and the actual coupon interest paid in cash.

### When a bond is issued at a premium, which of the following statements is correct with respect to interest expense over time using the effective interest method?

- [x] The interest expense decreases as the carrying value decreases.  
- [ ] The interest expense remains constant each period.  
- [ ] An increasing amount of premium is amortized each period.  
- [ ] Premiums are not amortized under the effective interest method.  

> **Explanation:** Under the effective interest method, the carrying amount of a premium bond decreases each period, which leads to a decrease in interest expense (yield rate × beginning carrying value).

### Which journal entry best describes retiring a bond issued at a discount before its maturity date at a price higher than its carrying amount?

- [x] Debit Bonds Payable, Debit Loss on Early Extinguishment, Credit Discount on Bonds Payable, Credit Cash.  
- [ ] Debit Bonds Payable, Credit Gain on Early Extinguishment, Debit Cash.  
- [ ] Debit Loss on Early Extinguishment, Credit Bonds Payable, Credit Discount on Bonds Payable.  
- [ ] Debit Bonds Payable, Credit Discount on Bonds Payable, Credit Cash.  

> **Explanation:** A loss occurs when the bond’s carrying amount is less than the reacquisition price. The difference is recorded as a loss on early extinguishment.

### Which statement is true regarding the straight-line method of amortization under U.S. GAAP?

- [x] It allocates equal amounts of discount or premium amortization over each period.  
- [ ] It is always required under U.S. GAAP.  
- [ ] Results are identical to the effective interest method.  
- [ ] It requires partial amortization in the initial period and then increasing amounts.  

> **Explanation:** The straight-line approach evenly allocates the discount or premium over the bond’s life but may not perfectly match interest expense with the underlying interest costs.

### Which of the following correctly identifies the carrying value of a bond?

- [x] Face amount ± unamortized premium or discount.  
- [ ] Always equals face value, regardless of premiums or discounts.  
- [x] Face amount plus accrued interest.  
- [ ] Face amount less any interest expense recognized.  

> **Explanation:** The carrying value begins at issuance proceeds and moves toward face value over time, adding back unamortized premium (if a premium bond) or subtracting unamortized discount (if a discount bond). Accrued interest is handled separately for interim reporting, but within a single period, it might be included in the carrying value depending on the date of measurement.

### Under the effective interest method, how does the discount or premium amortization pattern typically compare to the straight-line method?

- [x] The amounts vary each period, reflecting changes in the bond’s carrying value.  
- [ ] They are identical each period.  
- [ ] They are larger in earlier periods under the effective interest method.  
- [ ] The premium is amortized first, followed by the discount.  

> **Explanation:** The effective interest method calculates interest and amortization based on the carrying value at the beginning of each period, resulting in varying amortization amounts.

### Which of the following statements best describes early extinguishment of debt?

- [x] The issuer calls or redeems bonds before the maturity date, potentially recognizing a gain or loss.  
- [ ] The issuer automatically defaults on interest payments.  
- [ ] The issuer repays the entire bond amount at face value on its original maturity date.  
- [ ] It only applies to convertible bonds.  

> **Explanation:** Early extinguishment of debt occurs when the money borrowed is repaid or redeemed prior to the originally scheduled maturity date, often creating gains or losses recognized in the issuer’s income statement.

### True or False: When bonds issued at a discount or premium reach maturity, their carrying value always equals the face value.

- [x] True  
- [ ] False  

> **Explanation:** Over time, either through straight-line or effective interest amortization, the bond’s carrying value converges to face value at maturity.
