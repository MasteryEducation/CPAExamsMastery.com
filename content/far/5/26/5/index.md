## 26.5 Comprehensive Exercises Integrating Multiple FAR Topics

This section provides final capstone scenarios combining multiple Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR) concepts—ranging from revenue recognition and inventory management to property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), intangible assets, and more. These integrated exercises serve as a culminating study resource, enabling you to synthesize knowledge acquired throughout earlier chapters. Each scenario highlights interrelated transactions under U.S. GAAP, with references to IFRS variations where applicable. Work through these scenarios step by step to develop an advanced, holistic perspective on FAR topics.

### Introduction

In a real-world environment, accounting issues rarely present themselves in isolation. Instead, they arise under complex conditions that require applying multiple standards simultaneously. As you prepare for the CPA Exam—particularly the FAR section—the ability to manage multifaceted accounting scenarios becomes essential. This chapter offers comprehensive exercises designed to challenge your understanding of:

• Revenue recognition (ASC 606)  
• Inventory measurement (FIFO, LIFO, Weighted-Average, Lower of Cost or NRV)  
• PP&E transactions (capitalization, depreciation, impairments)  
• Intangible asset amortization and impairment  
• Interaction with other topics, such as deferred taxes, disclosures, and IFRS comparisons  

These exercises aim to replicate the complexity of real-life transactions and enhance your ability to discern the appropriate accounting treatments.

As shown, these topics rarely stand alone. For example, how you classify and measure inventory can affect revenue recognition timing, which in turn might influence PP&E considerations (e.g., capitalizing certain costs). Intangibles can overlay additional complexities—especially when internal-use software or brand-related expenditures are involved.

### Comprehensive Case Study One: Multisegment Manufacturing Company

#### Background

XYZ Manufacturing, Inc. produces specialized medical devices and related software. The company operates in several segments:

• Device Production: Manufactures medical devices subject to regulatory approval.  
• Software Development: Creates accompanying software sold as a bundled product or licensed separately.  
• Maintenance & Servicing: Provides after-market servicing and maintenance contracts.

XYZ Manufacturing uses the FIFO method for raw materials and finished goods inventory. The company recently adopted ASC 606 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), implementing a step-by-step approach to recognize revenue for bundled arrangements. Additionally, XYZ is in the process of capitalizing certain software development costs for internal use and evaluating intangible assets for potential impairment.

#### Transaction Details

1. Multiple-Element Sales Arrangement  
   XYZ signs a contract with a hospital network (the “Customer”) to deliver 30 specialized medical devices and the related software. The contract price is $3,000,000, which includes:  
   • $2,700,000 for the devices.  
   • $300,000 for a five-year software license.  

   Delivery of devices occurs upfront, while the software has an annual update component. Management determines there are two performance obligations: (1) medical devices, (2) software license including updates. The transaction price must be allocated based on observable standalone selling prices:  
   • Devices typically sell for $90,000 each.  
   • A similar software license (with updates) sells for $400,000 over five years.  
   
   However, the customer negotiated a discount as part of the bundle.

2. Inventory Purchase and Valuation  
   • In Q1, XYZ purchases raw materials for $500,000. Due to supply chain issues, the cost is slightly higher than usual.  
   • At quarter-end, $120,000 of raw materials remain in inventory. $380,000 of materials have been transferred into Work-in-Process (WIP).  
   • The company uses FIFO for raw materials and finished goods. Management must determine if the net realizable value of some slow-moving materials is below cost.

3. Construction of a New Production Facility (PP&E)  
   • XYZ invests $5,000,000 in constructing a new manufacturing facility to expand production capacity.  
   • Capitalized costs include materials, direct labor, interest on construction loans, and overhead directly attributable to the construction project.  
   • The facility is completed at the end of the fiscal year and is ready for use.

4. Software Development for Internal Use (Intangible Asset)  
   • The R&D team invests $600,000 in creating a proprietary software system used to track device performance in real-time.  
   • Certain costs are incurred after reaching the application development stage and qualify for capitalization under ASC 350-40 (Internal-Use Software).  
   • Management capitalizes $450,000 of these costs and records $150,000 as research expense.

5. Impairment Trigger for an Existing Patent  
   • XYZ acquired a patent for a specialized clamp design in a prior year.  
   • Competitor technology indicates a potential decline in the patent’s cash flow generation.  
   • Management performs a recoverability test (under U.S. GAAP) to determine if undiscounted future cash flows remain higher than the carrying amount. If they are below, the patent may be impaired.

#### Step-by-Step Accounting Analysis

1. Revenue Recognition for Bundled Products  
   (a) Identify the Contract and Performance Obligations:  
      There is one contract with two distinct performance obligations: the devices and the software license.  
   (b) Determine the Transaction Price:  
      Total price is $3,000,000.  
   (c) Allocate Transaction Price:  
      Standalone selling prices are:  
      – $90,000/device × 30 devices = $2,700,000  
      – $400,000 for the five-year software license  

      However, the contract price for the software is only $300,000, representing a bundled discount. Typically, the ratio method is used to allocate:

      • Relative fair value of devices = 2,700,000 / (2,700,000 + 400,000) = 87.10%  
      • Relative fair value of software = 400,000 / (2,700,000 + 400,000) = 12.90%  

      Multiply these ratios by the $3,000,000 total:

      • Devices portion: $3,000,000 × 87.10% = $2,613,000  
      • Software portion: $3,000,000 × 12.90% = $387,000  

      Because the contract only allocates $300,000 to the software in writing, some of that discount is reallocated to the devices based on relative standalone selling prices.

   (d) Recognize Revenue:  
      • Devices are delivered upfront; recognize device revenue when control transfers (likely at shipment or delivery) for $2,613,000.  
      • Software revenue is recognized over the five-year term, matching the period of updates. This will require a time-based recognition approach for $387,000 spread over five years, or $77,400 per year (assuming a straight-line pattern).

2. Inventory Measurement  
   • At quarter-end, raw materials are evaluated for net realizable value. If the slow-moving items have a market value lower than cost, an LCNRV (lower of cost or net realizable value) write-down is recorded.  
   • The value of WIP and finished goods should reflect FIFO costs.

3. PP&E Accounting  
   • The $5,000,000 spent on constructing the new facility includes direct materials, labor, and capitalized interest.  
   • Once completed and placed in service, XYZ must begin depreciating the facility over its estimated useful life.  
   • IFRS requires a similar approach but includes potential revaluation model options if the company opts for it.

4. Capitalization of Internal-Use Software  
   • ASC 350-40 specifies that software intended for internal use can be capitalized once the project enters the “application development stage.”  
   • Here, $450,000 is capitalized, while $150,000 remains R&D expense.  
   • The capitalized amount is subsequently amortized over the software’s useful life.

5. Patent Impairment  
   • Under U.S. GAAP, if the carrying amount of the patent cannot be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value.  
   • IFRS uses a one-step approach (recoverable amount vs. carrying amount). If carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, impairment is recognized immediately.

#### IFRS Differences

• Revenue Recognition: Both U.S. GAAP and IFRS use a five-step model, though IFRS is based on IFRS 15 with largely converged guidance.  
• PP&E: Under IFRS (IAS 16), companies may choose the cost model or revaluation model for subsequent measurement. U.S. GAAP does not allow revaluation.  
• Intangibles: IFRS has a one-step approach to impairment (IAS 36). U.S. GAAP uses a recoverability test followed by a measurement of loss.  

#### Summary

Case Study One showcases how pivotal it is to integrate different ASC topics—particularly revenue recognition, inventory measurement, PP&E capitalization, intangible asset treatment, and impairment analysis. By working through each step and applying the appropriate authoritative guidance, accountants can ensure accurate, faithful representation of XYZ Manufacturing’s financial position and performance.

### Comprehensive Case Study Two: Hybrid Retail-Technology Enterprise

#### Background

ACME Tech-Retail Co. sells consumer electronics both online and through retail outlets. It also develops proprietary mobile applications that integrate with the electronics sold. Because of its hybrid model, ACME must address complex issues around return rights, vendor allowances, intangible assets (licenses), and a newly launched subscription service that bundles hardware and software support.

#### Transaction Details

1. Subscription Services (Hardware + Software Bundle)  
   • ACME offers a “TechPlus” subscription service at $250 per month for 24 months.  
   • Subscribers receive a physical accessory kit (smartwatch device) upfront (retail value $400) and ongoing access to the ACME mobile application (retail value $25/month).  
   • The contract also includes a loyalty program that rewards points to be used on future purchases.  

2. Inventory Management and Return Rights  
   • ACME invests heavily in new electronics inventory costing $800,000.  
   • Historically, the company experiences a return rate of 5% within 30 days of purchase. Under ASC 606, a portion of revenue may be deferred to account for expected returns.  
   • Inventory also includes aging stock from the prior year. Management suspects potential obsolescence.

3. PP&E Upgrade and Depreciation  
   • ACME acquires specialized shop equipment for $300,000.  
   • The equipment has an estimated useful life of three years with no salvage value. Management chooses the double-declining balance (DDB) depreciation method.

4. Brand License Agreement (Intangible Asset)  
   • ACME licenses a well-known brand name for use on an exclusive co-branded product line for three years.  
   • The licensing fee is $450,000 paid upfront. Accounting must assess whether the license intangible is amortized over three years or if a portion is allocated to brand-building expenses.

5. Software Development for Third-Party Sale  
   • ACME invests $200,000 in creating a consumer-facing application that will be sold in app stores. Because the software is intended for external sale, slightly different guidelines apply compared to internal-use software.  
   • Under ASC 985-20, certain development costs can be capitalized once the software has reached technological feasibility.

#### Step-by-Step Accounting Analysis

1. Revenue Recognition: “TechPlus” Subscription  
   • Identify Performance Obligations:  
     – Hardware (smartwatch device)  
     – Monthly software access  
     – Loyalty points  
   • Determine Transaction Price:  
     $250 × 24 months = $6,000 total contract price.  
   • Allocate Transaction Price:  
     Standalone selling prices might be:  
     – Smartwatch device: $400  
     – Monthly application access: $25 × 24 = $600  
     – Loyalty points: Typically 10% discount on future purchases. Management estimates the standalone selling price of these points at $200.  

     Total standalone selling prices = $400 + $600 + $200 = $1,200. However, the contract requires $6,000 in total payments over 24 months. Because the apparent discount is large, you allocate the $6,000 proportionately.

     Allocation example:  
     – Device portion: $400 ÷ $1,200 = 33.3%, so 33.3% × $6,000 = $1,998  
     – Application portion: $600 ÷ $1,200 = 50.0%, so 50.0% × $6,000 = $3,000  
     – Loyalty points portion: $200 ÷ $1,200 = 16.7%, so 16.7% × $6,000 = $1,002  

   • Recognize Revenue:  
     – The device portion ($1,998) is recognized when control transfers (upon delivery at subscription sign-up).  
     – The application portion ($3,000) is recognized ratably over 24 months ($125/month).  
     – The loyalty points portion ($1,002) is initially deferred and recognized when customers redeem points or when the points expire.

2. Returns and Inventory Obsolescence  
   • ACME estimates a 5% return rate. For every $1,000 of product revenue, it defers $50 (5%) as a refund liability and records a corresponding adjustment to inventory for the right of return asset.  
   • The aging stock is tested for potential obsolescence. If cost exceeds net realizable value, a write-down is recorded.  

3. PP&E: Specialized Shop Equipment  
   • ACME capitalizes the $300,000 purchase cost.  
   • Using Double-Declining Balance (DDB):  
     Yearly depreciation = (2 / Useful Life) × Book Value at the beginning of period.  
     In Year 1: (2/3) × $300,000 = $200,000 depreciation expense.  
     In Year 2 and beyond, the book value is updated.

4. Brand License Agreement  
   • The license is an intangible asset if it meets the definition of providing future economic benefits.  
   • Typically amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year term (assuming no indefinite life).  
   • IFRS (IAS 38) also amortizes intangible assets over their useful lives unless indefinite.  

5. Software Developed for External Sale  
   • ASC 985-20 requires costs incurred after technological feasibility is established to be capitalized, and prior costs are expensed as R&D.  
   • The recognized intangible asset is amortized over the product’s estimated economic life, beginning when the product is available for general release to customers.

#### IFRS Differences

• IFRS 15 revenue recognition is essentially converged with ASC 606, though subtle differences in disclosure exist (e.g., IFRS 15 provides a bit more guidance on licensing revenue).  
• For returns, IFRS likewise requires establishing a refund liability, though IFRS focuses on repurchase obligations if the arrangement includes some type of buyback.  
• Under IAS 38, costs for software developed for sale are capitalized if they meet stringent criteria regarding probable future economic benefits, measurement reliability, and intangible asset definitions.

#### Summary

This second case study highlights a subscription model with multiple performance obligations, inventory returns, intangible licenses, and specialized accounting for software. By carefully applying the relevant standards—ASC 606, ASC 330 (Inventory), ASC 360 (PP&E), ASC 350/985 (Intangibles and Software)—entities can maintain an accurate depiction of financial performance across diverse revenue streams.

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

• Pitfall: Misidentifying performance obligations.  
  Always apply the five-step revenue recognition model, ensuring each promised good or service is distinct.

• Pitfall: Overlooking software development nuances.  
  Distinguish between internal-use software (ASC 350-40) and external-sale software (ASC 985-20).

• Best Practice: Conduct periodic impairment assessments.  
  Both finite-lived intangible assets and PP&E should undergo annual or triggering-event-based impairment evaluations.

• Best Practice: Maintain robust documentation.  
  Complex transactions call for thorough write-ups on the rationale behind each accounting treatment.

• Best Practice: Use consistent allocation methods.  
  Whether for bundling discounts, loyalty programs, or multiple elements, consistency fosters transparency and auditability.

### Visual Comparison of GAAP vs. IFRS for Key Topics

Below is a brief table summarizing differences in several key areas:

| Topic             | U.S. GAAP                                | IFRS                                       |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Revenue (Bundles) | ASC 606, five-step model                  | IFRS 15, largely converged                 |
| PP&E Valuation    | Cost model only                          | Cost or revaluation model under IAS 16     |
| Impairment (PP&E) | Two-step: recoverability + measurement   | One-step test under IAS 36                 |
| Intangible Assets | Cost model, finite vs. indefinite lived  | IAS 38: cost model or revaluation in some cases |

### Final Thoughts

These comprehensive scenarios demonstrate that applying FAR concepts in practice often involves blending multiple standards. By methodically evaluating where each cost or revenue item belongs—whether in inventory, PP&E, or intangible assets—and determining the corresponding revenue recognition pattern, you can arrive at faithful, decision-useful financial statements. Always keep an eye on IFRS distinctions, especially regarding impairment, intangible asset measurement, and revaluation alternatives.

Gaining comfort with these integrated concepts is a critical milestone in your CPA Exam preparation. Use these case studies as a prototype to hone your analytical skills. Explore additional variations—like partial asset disposals, changes in estimates, or accelerating intangible asset amortization—so you are ready to tackle any challenge the FAR exam may present.

## Comprehensive FAR Topics Mastery Quiz

{{< quizdown >}}

### ABC Corporation offers a bundled contract for hardware and software. Under U.S. GAAP, which approach is primarily used to allocate the transaction price among multiple performance obligations?

- [ ] Vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE)
- [ ] Cost-plus approach
- [x] Relative standalone selling price (RSSP) method
- [ ] LIFO approach

> **Explanation:** Under ASC 606, the total contract price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each good or service.

### Which of the following is capitalized under ASC 350-40 for internal-use software?

- [x] Costs incurred during the application development stage
- [ ] Market research costs
- [ ] Preliminary project stage costs
- [ ] General admin salaries for the entire department

> **Explanation:** Only costs in the application development stage (e.g., coding after achieving conceptual formulation) are capitalized. Preliminary and post-implementation stage costs are generally expensed.

### A company using FIFO for inventory discovers that, at year-end, the net realizable value of certain items is below cost. They should:

- [x] Write down the inventory to net realizable value
- [ ] Depreciate the inventory over its useful life
- [ ] Do nothing
- [ ] Reverse some previously recognized revenue

> **Explanation:** Under lower of cost or net realizable value (LCNRV), a write-down must be recognized when NRV falls below cost.  

### Under IFRS, an entity may apply the revaluation model to:

- [x] Property, plant, and equipment
- [ ] Inventory
- [ ] Goodwill
- [ ] Financial liabilities at amortized cost

> **Explanation:** IAS 16 permits the revaluation model for PP&E. Inventory is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value under IAS 2. Goodwill is not revalued, and financial liabilities at amortized cost follow IFRS 9.

### When determining if a patent is impaired under U.S. GAAP, what is the first step?

- [x] Assess whether undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount
- [ ] Immediately write down to fair value
- [x] Measure the difference between carrying amount and recoverable amount
- [ ] Recognize a loss equal to the full carrying value

> **Explanation:** U.S. GAAP requires a recoverability test (based on undiscounted cash flows). If that test is failed, an impairment loss equals the difference between carrying amount and fair value. (Note that IFRS uses a one-step approach.)

### A company records a brand license fee paid to a third party. The license is valid for five years, with no indefinite renewal options. Under U.S. GAAP, how should this intangible be accounted for?

- [x] As a finite-lived intangible, amortized over five years
- [ ] As property, plant, and equipment
- [ ] As goodwill
- [ ] Expensed immediately

> **Explanation:** The brand license, having a contractual term of five years, is amortized over its definite useful life.

### Which depreciation method accelerates expense recognition by applying a constant rate to the asset’s declining book value?

- [x] Double-declining balance
- [ ] Straight-line
- [x] Units-of-production
- [ ] Sum-of-the-years’-digits

> **Explanation:** Double-declining balance multiplies the beginning-of-period book value by a fixed rate (e.g., 2 ÷ useful life). Units-of-production is based on usage, and sum-of-the-years’-digits is another form of accelerated depreciation but not constant-rate-based.

### Under ASC 985-20, when are software development costs typically capitalized for products to be sold to external customers?

- [x] After technological feasibility is established
- [ ] Immediately when coding begins  
- [ ] Only if the target market is large
- [ ] Never, since development is R&D

> **Explanation:** For external-sale software, costs are capitalized once technological feasibility is established and continue until the product is ready for general release.

### Which of the following best describes the accounting treatment for loyalty points under ASC 606?

- [x] They represent a separate performance obligation, requiring allocation of the transaction price.
- [ ] They are recognized as a liability only after customers redeem them.
- [ ] They are ignored until the end of the contract term.
- [ ] They should only reduce sales revenue when redeemed.

> **Explanation:** Loyalty points are generally treated as a separate performance obligation. A portion of the transaction price must be allocated to the points and deferred until redemption or expiry.

### Using the two-step approach to impairment under U.S. GAAP, what occurs if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted future cash flows?

- [x] An impairment loss is measured as the difference between carrying amount and fair value.
- [ ] No loss is recognized until the asset’s remaining book value is zero.
- [ ] The asset is written up based on a revaluation model.
- [ ] The entity can defer recognition until the next period.

> **Explanation:** Failing the recoverability test under U.S. GAAP triggers an impairment measurement. The difference between carrying amount and fair value is recognized as a loss.
