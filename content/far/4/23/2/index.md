## 23.2 Lessor Accounting (Sales-Type, Direct Financing, Operating)

When accounting for leases, lessors must apply distinct approaches depending on their classification of a lease. Under ASC 842, the main categories for lessors are sales-type leases, direct financing leases, and operating leases. Each classification has implications for how and when revenue is recognized, how any interest income is recorded, and whether the underlying asset remains on the lessor’s balance sheet. Understanding the criteria and proper accounting treatment for each category is crucial for accurate financial reporting and consistency with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the three lessor accounting methods. You will discover the conceptual framework for each classification, how to evaluate your lease arrangement against the criteria, practical examples that illustrate the concepts, and tables and diagrams to more clearly visualize and compare the different treatments. This discussion aims to help you feel confident in applying lessor accounting rules in various scenarios, whether you are preparing for the CPA exam or dealing with real-life lease transactions in practice.

## Understanding Lessor Accounting Under ASC 842

Before diving deeper into each lease classification, let’s establish an overview of how lessor accounting fits within the ASC 842 framework. In essence, the lessor must evaluate whether the lease transfers control (including substantially all of the risks and rewards) of the underlying asset to the lessee. If the criteria indicate that such control is transferred, the lessor recognizes a net investment in the lease rather than continuing to hold that asset on its balance sheet. If control is not effectively transferred, the lease remains an operating lease, and the lessor continues to report the asset on its balance sheet, recognizing lease income over the lease term.

A key focus in lessor accounting is whether the arrangement is effectively a sale (i.e., the contract meets certain “sales-type” criteria), a direct financing arrangement, or a traditional operating lease. The following sections explore the details of each classification, including how to conceptualize these categories, how to apply the respective accounting methods, and what typical journal entries look like in different scenarios.

## Classifying the Lease Arrangement

ASC 842 provides specific criteria that guide whether a lessor should treat the lease as a sales-type lease, direct financing lease, or operating lease. The general classification approach is outlined below:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A([Lease Classification]) --> B{Does the lease transfer\ncontrol of the asset?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Sales-Type Lease\n(assess profit/loss\nrecognition at commencement)]
    B -->|No, but lessor\nachieves certain\ncriteria| D[Direct Financing Lease]
    B -->|No| E[Operating Lease\n(asset kept on \nlessor's books)]
```

The specific classification depends on evaluating conditions such as:  
• Whether the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term.  
• Whether the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised.  
• Whether the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset.  
• Whether the present value of lease payments plus any residual guarantees is substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset.  
• Whether the asset is of such a specialized nature that it is only expected to have value to the lessee.  

If any of these conditions is met, the lease is typically categorized as a sales-type lease (if there is a selling profit or loss at inception) or a direct financing lease. Otherwise, it is recorded as an operating lease.

## Sales-Type Leases

### Overview

A sales-type lease arises when the lessor effectively transfers control of the underlying asset to the lessee. Practically, this means the lease arrangement meets one or more of the finance lease criteria from the lessee’s perspective, and the lessor must recognize any selling profit or loss at inception if the carrying amount of the asset is different from its fair value. Essentially, it is as though the lessor sold the asset to the lessee and is financing the purchase by providing a lease. The transaction is accounted for in a manner similar to revenue from the sale of goods or products, combined with financing income over time.

### Revenue Recognition at Commencement

If the fair value of the leased asset differs from its carrying amount on the lessor’s books, the lessor recognizes a profit or loss at commencement. The process is akin to the sale of the asset:

1. Remove the underlying asset from the balance sheet.  
2. Recognize sales revenue (or cost of goods sold) equal to the asset’s fair value (or carrying amount).  
3. Recognize any selling profit (or loss) for the difference between fair value and carrying amount.  
4. Recognize a net investment in the lease, which is measured as the present value of future lease payments plus any unguaranteed residual asset.

### Interest Income

After inception, the lessor recognizes interest income on the net investment in the lease. Over the lease term, lease payments reduce the net investment, and interest income is recorded in a manner that produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment. The interest component is recognized as the implied rate in the lease (referred to as the discount rate or effective interest rate). This income is typically disclosed separately from other revenue streams.

Below is an illustrative example of the key journal entry at commencement for a sales-type lease (assuming a profit situation):

• At lease commencement (removal of asset and recognition of lease receivable):

  Dr. Net Investment in Lease (Asset)  
  Dr. Cost of Goods Sold  
  Cr. Sales Revenue  
  Cr. Underlying Asset (carrying amount removed from books)  
  (Recognize any difference between cost and fair value as profit or loss.)

Over time, the net investment in lease is reduced by the portion of lease payments attributable to principal, while interest income is recognized using the effective interest method.

### Practical Example

Imagine a lessor with a piece of machinery having a carrying amount of $80,000 and a fair value of $100,000. The lessor leases the machinery to a lessee for five years. The lessee is obliged to pay an annual lease payment of $25,000, which has a present value of $100,000 at an appropriate discount rate. Here is a simplified depiction of the commencement entry:

• Remove asset at carrying amount ($80,000).  
• Recognize sales revenue of $100,000 (the fair value).  
• Recognize cost of goods sold of $80,000.  
• Recognize an immediate profit of $20,000.  
• Record a net investment in the lease of $100,000, which will earn interest income over five years.

Thus, at inception:

- Dr. Net Investment in Lease (Asset)  $100,000  
- Dr. Cost of Goods Sold              $ 80,000  
- Cr. Sales Revenue                   $100,000  
- Cr. Machinery (Asset)               $ 80,000  

Profit recognized immediately is $20,000. Over the lease term, the lessor will record interest income on the net investment, reducing that net investment as payments are received.

---

## Direct Financing Leases

### Overview

A direct financing lease from the lessor’s perspective is intended to finance the “purchase” of the underlying asset by the lessee, but without recognizing an immediate selling profit or loss at the inception date (or if such profit or loss is deferred). In other words, either:  
• The fair value of the asset is equal to its carrying amount, so there’s no initial gain or loss.  
• There might be a minor difference that is deferred and recognized over the lease term.

In a direct financing lease, control of the asset effectively transfers to the lessee (the lessor has transferred the risks and rewards associated with the asset, except for certain residual interest in many cases), but the lessor experiences no upfront gain or loss on the “sale.”

### Removal of Asset and Recognition of Lease Receivable

Similar to a sales-type lease, the lessor removes the underlying asset from its balance sheet and recognizes a net investment in the lease at the outset. However, instead of recognizing any upfront selling profit, the lessor defers the profit (if any) and amortizes it over the lease term via the effective interest method. Often, there may be no difference between fair value and the carrying value in a classic direct financing arrangement, which means no immediate income effect at inception.

The net investment comprises:  
• The present value of the lease payments (including any residual value guarantee).  
• Any initial direct costs that the lessor incurred.  
• Any unguaranteed residual asset.

### Interest Income

During the lease term, the lessor earns a return on its net investment in the lease, recognized as interest income using the effective interest method. As lease payments are received, the net investment declines. A consistent rate of return is applied each period, similar to how interest revenue would be recognized on a typical note receivable.

### Illustrative Example

Assume a lessor has equipment on its books at a carrying amount of $150,000, which is also its fair value, and leases the equipment to a lessee under terms that qualify as a direct financing lease. The lessee agrees to make five annual payments of $36,000 each, with a present value of $150,000 at the agreed-upon discount rate.

• Because fair value ($150,000) equals carrying amount ($150,000), no selling profit or loss is recognized at inception.  
• The lessor removes the asset from its books and recognizes a net investment in lease of $150,000.  

At commencement:

- Dr. Net Investment in Lease  $150,000  
- Cr. Equipment                $150,000  

Over the lease term, the lessor records interest income on the net investment, causing it to decrease as principal is recovered through the receipt of lease payments. Because there is no difference between the carrying amount and fair value, there is no profit or loss recognized at inception.

## Operating Leases (Lessor Perspective)

### Overview

When a lease arrangement does not meet the criteria for sales-type or direct financing classification, the lease is classified as an operating lease. In an operating lease, the lessor retains economic ownership and continues to recognize the asset on its balance sheet. The underlying asset remains subject to depreciation, and the lessor recognizes lease revenue (rental income) on a systematic basis (often straight-line) over the lease term.

### Key Characteristics

• The lease does not transfer control or the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.  
• The lessor effectively continues to bear the risks of ownership (e.g., residual value risk, obsolescence risk).  
• The lessor retains the asset on its balance sheet and depreciates it under its normal accounting policies.  

### Revenue Recognition

Lease income for an operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis, or another systematic basis if it is more representative of the pattern in which benefit is derived from the underlying asset. The rental revenue is typically the periodic lease payment as stated in the lease agreement. Initial direct costs are generally deferred and recognized as an expense over the lease term, in proportion to the revenue recognized.

### Journal Entries

Under an operating lease, the underlying asset remains on the lessor’s balance sheet. The journal entries for each lease payment period might look something like this:

- Dr. Cash (or Accounts Receivable)       $XXX  
  Cr. Rental (Lease) Income              $XXX  

Separately, the lessor recognizes depreciation or amortization expense on the asset:

- Dr. Depreciation Expense               $YYY  
  Cr. Accumulated Depreciation           $YYY  

Thus, the periodic recognition of rental income and depreciation reflects the underlying economics: the lessor still “owns” the asset and is temporarily granting the lessee the right to use it.

### Example

Suppose a lessor owns property that it carries on its balance sheet at $300,000 (net of accumulated depreciation). The lessor enters into a two-year operating lease that requires annual payments of $40,000. The lessor continues to record depreciation on the property each year. The operating lease revenue is recognized as $40,000 per year, typically on a straight-line basis. The relevant entries include:

• At the beginning of each year (when lease payment is received):

  - Dr. Cash                       $40,000  
    Cr. Lease (Rental) Income     $40,000  

• At year-end (depreciation):

  - Dr. Depreciation Expense      $15,000  (for illustration)  
    Cr. Accumulated Depreciation  $15,000  

In this scenario, the property remains in the lessor’s PP&E account, and the lessor continues regular depreciation procedures.

## Comparison of the Three Types

The following table highlights some key differences:

|                         | Sales-Type Lease                    | Direct Financing Lease                     | Operating Lease                                           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Ownership Transfer      | Control effectively transferred to lessee if lease criteria met. Asset removed from books. | Control effectively transferred but no immediate profit or loss recognized. Asset removed from books. | No control transferred; lessor retains economic ownership. Asset remains on lessor’s balance sheet. |
| Initial Profit/Loss     | Recognized if FV ≠ carrying amount  | Deferred or none if FV = carrying amount   | No initial profit or loss recognized                      |
| Net Investment in Lease | Recognized, includes residual value | Recognized, includes residual value        | Not applicable, asset is retained by lessor               |
| Interest Income         | Effective interest on net investment | Effective interest on net investment       | Not separately disclosed as interest; rental income recorded |
| Depreciation            | No depreciation by lessor (asset off books) | No depreciation by lessor (asset off books) | Lessor continues to depreciate the asset                  |
| Revenue Recognition     | Upfront revenue plus ongoing interest | Ongoing interest over lease term           | Straight-line or systematic basis for rental income       |

## Common Pitfalls and Challenges

• Misclassifying the lease: In practice, borderline situations can exist where it is unclear whether a lease transfers control. The lessor must carefully evaluate the explicit criteria in ASC 842.  
• Residual value assumptions: Estimating the residual value of an asset can drastically affect classification and measurement, especially for direct financing leases.  
• Calculating the discount rate: Using an incorrect discount rate can result in inaccurate present value computations for the net investment in lease.  
• Tracking initial direct costs: Properly accounting for initial direct costs (e.g., legal fees, commissions) can change the amount of net investment in a sales-type or direct financing lease, leading to differences in income recognition.  
• Handling modifications: Changes to lease terms can alter the classification or measurement of an existing lease under ASC 842.  

---

## Best Practices

• Perform robust discount rate analyses and document assumptions around the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate or other relevant rates.  
• Keep clear records of initial direct costs so that they are allocated properly to the net investment in a direct financing or sales-type lease.  
• Carefully consider residual value estimates and their related disclosures.  
• Use system and process controls to track lease payments, including timing, amounts, and any contractual escalations.  
• Continuously monitor for lease modifications or re-measurements, which can affect the classification or the net investment in the lease.  

---

## Real-World Scenarios

• Technology equipment leases: Lessors might enter into leases for laptop fleets or specialized tools. If there is a significant upgrade path or short lease term, classification is often operating. However, if control is significantly transferred, a sales-type or direct financing approach might apply.  
• Automotive leasing: Automakers and financing arms frequently provide leases to customers. They typically assess the fair value of the vehicle at lease inception and compare it to the residual value. Many auto leases end up being sales-type or direct financing leases when the financing subsidiary acts as the lessor.  
• Commercial real estate leasing: Many commercial office leases are classified as operating because the building is expected to revert to the lessor, and no single lease occupant meets the transfer-of-control criteria. However, certain specialized property or integral capital improvements might trigger different accounting.

## An Illustrative Case Study

Assume a manufacturing company (LessorCo) specializes in custom-manufactured equipment. LessorCo’s cost of producing a specialized machine is $200,000, and it sells for a fair value of $250,000. LessorCo enters into a lease with a customer for four years, collecting either a lump-sum payment of $50,000 at inception and annual $50,000 payments each year. The present value of the lease payments is $250,000 at a 5% discount rate.

• Because the fair value ($250,000) is well above the carrying amount ($200,000), LessorCo recognizes a $50,000 selling profit if the arrangement meets the sales-type lease criteria.  
• LessorCo removes the machine from its balance sheet, recognizing cost of goods sold ($200,000) and revenue ($250,000).  
• If, for instance, LessorCo had manufactured it for $200,000 but the fair value was exactly $200,000, the lease could qualify as a direct financing lease instead, with no immediate profit.  

Once in place, LessorCo accrues interest income on the net investment in the lease each year, using the effective interest method so that the net investment is reduced as LessorCo receives annual lease payments.

## IFRS Note

Under IFRS 16, lessors continue to distinguish between finance leases and operating leases, somewhat akin to U.S. GAAP’s sales-type/direct financing group and operating leases. However, IFRS does not separately distinguish “sales-type” from “direct financing” leases in the same manner that U.S. GAAP does, although, in practice, many of the outcomes are similar. Convergence efforts have brought some similarities, but key differences remain in areas such as measurement, initial direct costs, and presentation.

---

## Summary

Lessor accounting under ASC 842 requires identifying whether a lease is sales-type, direct financing, or operating. Sales-type and direct financing leases involve removing the asset from the lessor’s balance sheet, recognizing a net investment in the lease, and accruing interest income. The primary difference lies in recognizing an upfront profit or loss under a sales-type lease. Operating leases maintain the underlying asset on the lessor’s balance sheet, with revenue recognized on a systematic (often straight-line) basis and ongoing depreciation of the asset.

Understanding these distinctions is pivotal for proper financial reporting and for preparing to address lease-related questions on the CPA exam. By grasping how each lease classification handles revenue, expense, and balance sheet presentation, you can confidently navigate real-world lease arrangements and examine them within the broader context of GAAP and IFRS requirements.

{{< quizdown >}}

### Which of the following statements best describes a sales-type lease?

- [x] The lessor removes the asset from its books and recognizes a profit or loss if the fair value differs from the carrying amount.
- [ ] The lessor keeps the asset on the books and recognizes no initial profit.  
- [ ] The fair value of the asset always equals its carrying amount.
- [ ] The lessor retains ownership, but the lessee bears depreciation expense.

> **Explanation:** In a sales-type lease, the lessor treats the transaction similarly to a sale, removing the asset from its books and recognizing any immediate profit or loss.

### How does a lessor typically recognize income in a direct financing lease?

- [x] It recognizes interest income over the lease term using the effective interest method.
- [ ] It recognizes income on a straight-line basis for each lease payment.
- [ ] It recognizes a large profit at the commencement date.
- [ ] It does not recognize any income until the end of the lease term.

> **Explanation:** In a direct financing lease, the lessor removes the underlying asset from its balance sheet and recognizes interest income over the lease term based on the effective interest method, with no upfront selling profit.

### In an operating lease for the lessor, how is depreciation handled?

- [x] The lessor continues to depreciate the asset, as it remains on its books. 
- [ ] The lessee records the depreciation expense on the asset.
- [ ] Depreciation is only recognized at the end of the lease term.
- [ ] No depreciation is required because the lease transfers control of the underlying asset.

> **Explanation:** Under an operating lease, the lessor does not transfer control or ownership; thus, the lessor retains the asset and must continue to depreciate it over its useful life.

### Imagine a lessor manufactures equipment for $75,000, and its fair value at lease inception is $100,000. If the lease meets the sales-type lease criteria, what happens to the difference between the carrying amount and fair value?

- [x] The lessor recognizes a $25,000 profit at commencement.
- [ ] The lessor recognizes no profit and defers the entire $25,000.
- [ ] The lessor capitalizes the $25,000 as part of the net investment in lease.
- [ ] The lessor subtracts the $25,000 from future interest income.

> **Explanation:** For a sales-type lease, if fair value exceeds the carrying amount, the lessor recognizes a profit equal to the difference at commencement.

### In which lease type does the lessor typically not remove the underlying asset from its balance sheet?

- [x] Operating lease
- [ ] Sales-type lease
- [x] Direct financing lease
- [ ] Finance lease under IFRS

> **Explanation:** Under operating leases, the lessor retains the asset on its balance sheet and continues to depreciate it. By contrast, assets under sales-type or direct financing leases are removed from the lessor’s PP&E.

### When a lessor classifies a lease as direct financing and the fair value of the asset equals its carrying amount, how is profit recognized?

- [x] No immediate profit is recognized at the commencement of the lease.
- [ ] Profit is recognized immediately for the difference between fair value and carrying amount.
- [ ] Profit is recognized on a straight-line basis alongside depreciation.
- [ ] Profit is recorded as deferred revenue and never amortized.

> **Explanation:** In direct financing leases, there is no upfront profit or loss recognition if the fair value equals the carrying amount. Instead, income is subsequently recognized as interest over the lease term.

### In both sales-type and direct financing leases, what is the lessor’s main source of income after the commencement date?

- [x] Interest income on the net investment in the lease.
- [ ] Lease revenue reported on a straight-line basis.
- [x] Depreciation of the underlying asset.
- [ ] No income is recognized.

> **Explanation:** For both sales-type and direct financing leases, the lessor’s main post-commencement income is interest, as the lessor has essentially provided financing to the lessee.

### Which of the following is a key criterion that suggests a lease should be classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease rather than an operating lease?

- [x] The lease term is for the major part of the underlying asset’s remaining economic life.
- [ ] No lease payments are made until the end of the lease.
- [ ] The lease agreement specifically states “Operating Lease” in its header.
- [ ] The lessor retains the entire residual risk with no guarantees from the lessee.

> **Explanation:** If the lease term covers the major part of the asset’s remaining economic life, this implies that substantially all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred, potentially classifying the lease as sales-type or direct financing.

### Under an operating lease, initial direct costs incurred by the lessor are typically:

- [x] Deferred and expensed over the lease term in proportion to revenue recognized.
- [ ] Recognized immediately as an expense at lease commencement.
- [ ] Added to the carrying amount of the underlying asset and never expensed.
- [ ] Recognized as a contra-liability on the balance sheet.

> **Explanation:** For operating leases, initial direct costs are deferred and recognized over the lease term, in line with the recognition of rental income.

### A lessor with a direct financing lease records depreciation expense on the leased asset in its financial statements.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

> **Explanation:** This statement is false. In a direct financing lease, the lessor removes the asset from its balance sheet and instead records a net investment in the lease. Depreciation of the underlying asset (by the lessor) is not recognized because the lessor no longer carries the asset.
