## 8.1 Horizontal and Vertical Analysis Techniques

Financial statement analysis is crucial for both internal and external stakeholders who seek to interpret a company’s performance, financial health, and future prospects. In the context of the CPA Exam — and particularly the Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR) section — candidates should possess a firm grasp of the two most fundamental analytical methods: horizontal analysis and vertical analysis. Each approach provides unique insights, and collectively, they form a robust toolkit for evaluating changes over time, identifying emerging trends, and benchmarking across firms of different sizes.

This section offers an in-depth exploration of horizontal and vertical analysis techniques, the differences between them, practical examples, usage scenarios, and best practices. By weaving in relevant references to Chapters 3, 4, and other areas of this guide, you will gain a comprehensive framework to approach these analyses for for-profit and not-for-profit entities, governmental entities, and other types of organizations.

Use this chapter as an integral stepping stone to understand the bigger picture before delving into more advanced analytical methods like ratio analysis (see later sections of Chapter 8) and advanced performance metrics.

## Overview

Financial statement analysis typically starts with a look at how the numbers have changed over time (horizontal analysis) and how each line item relates to a larger total on a single set of financial statements (vertical analysis). These techniques can be applied to:

• Balance Sheets  
• Income Statements (or Statements of Operations)  
• Statements of Cash Flows  
• Statements of Changes in Equity  
• Not-for-Profit or Governmental Financial Statements (adapted accordingly)  

Below is a concise overview of each technique:

• Horizontal Analysis (Trend Analysis): Compares financial data across multiple periods (usually years), seeking variances in dollar amounts or percentages.  
• Vertical Analysis (Common-Size Analysis): Expresses each item on a financial statement as a percentage of a base figure within the same period. For instance, on the income statement, each item can be shown as a percentage of net sales (revenue); on the balance sheet, items can be presented as a percentage of total assets.

These two approaches often work best when used together. Horizontal analysis helps pinpoint changes in specific line items over time, whereas vertical analysis places those line items in context and highlights structural shifts in the financial statements.

## Horizontal Analysis

Horizontal analysis, also known as trend analysis, observes the changes in key financial statement items over a series of reporting periods. By establishing one period (often the earliest in the set) as the base and comparing subsequent periods to this base, horizontal analysis reveals trends that may indicate growth, contraction, or erratic patterns in a company’s operations.

### Key Concepts

• Base Period: The reference year or period to which all subsequent periods are compared.  
• Dollar Change: The difference in exact dollar amounts between a current year and a base year.  
• Percentage Change: Derived by dividing the dollar change by the base period amount and expressing the result as a percentage.  
• Multiple Periods: Often, horizontal analysis spans three to five years or even more (depending on data availability).

Horizontal analysis is particularly helpful for:

• Identifying year-over-year revenue growth or decline.  
• Tracking how certain expenses fluctuate in relation to sales or changes in market conditions.  
• Observing patterns in asset balances such as inventory or receivables.  
• Evaluating the pace of liability changes, especially when studying debt levels.

### Illustrative Example

Suppose ABC Company has the following net sales figures:

• Year 1: $200,000  
• Year 2: $250,000  
• Year 3: $300,000  

Using Year 1 ($200,000) as the base, you can calculate both the dollar and percentage changes for subsequent years:

• Year 2 vs. Year 1:  
  – Dollar Change: $250,000 – $200,000 = $50,000  
  – Percentage Change: ($50,000 / $200,000) × 100 = 25%  

• Year 3 vs. Year 1:  
  – Dollar Change: $300,000 – $200,000 = $100,000  
  – Percentage Change: ($100,000 / $200,000) × 100 = 50%  

Thus, a quick horizontal analysis reveals a net sales increase of 25% from Year 1 to Year 2, and 50% from Year 1 to Year 3. In a more robust analysis, you would extend this method to cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and net income, thus painting a detailed picture of the company’s profitability and stability.

### Advantages and Limitations of Horizontal Analysis

Advantages:  
• Highlights growth patterns and decline areas over different periods.  
• Helps analysts and stakeholders identify when revenues stagnate or shrink against a fast-growing cost structure.  
• Flags potentially problematic areas, such as ballooning liabilities or excessive inventory buildup.

Limitations:  
• Requires consistent accounting methods across all periods (changes in accounting policies or GAAP can distort trends).  
• May be skewed by significant, non-recurring events (e.g., acquisitions, discontinued operations).  
• Does not reveal changes in relation to total assets, net sales, or other broad measures of size.

## Vertical Analysis

While horizontal analysis focuses on changes over time, vertical analysis gives insight into the proportional relationship of each item within a single set of financial statements. For the balance sheet, each line is calculated as a percentage of total assets (or total liabilities and equity). For the income statement, each line item appears as a percentage of net sales (or total revenue).

### Key Concepts

• Common-Size Financial Statements: The resulting statements after applying vertical analysis, conveniently showing each item’s relative size.  
• Base Amount: 
  – Income Statement: Often net sales or total revenues.  
  – Balance Sheet: Typically total assets, or total liabilities plus shareholders’ equity.  
  – Statement of Cash Flows: Could employ total inflows or outflows as a base for certain lines if an entity wants to highlight operational vs. investing vs. financing components.  

### Illustrative Example

Below is a simplified income statement for XYZ Company for Year 1:

• Net Sales: $400,000 (base)  
• Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $280,000  
• Gross Profit: $120,000  
• Operating Expenses: $60,000  
• Net Income: $30,000  

Note that $30,000 for net income implicitly means there might be additional expense items such as interest and taxes not shown in this simplified example. The sum of all expense line items plus net income should equal the $400,000 in net sales.

Applying vertical analysis, you re-state each line as a percentage of $400,000:

• Net Sales: $400,000 / $400,000 = 100%  
• Cost of Goods Sold: $280,000 / $400,000 = 70%  
• Gross Profit: $120,000 / $400,000 = 30%  
• Operating Expenses: $60,000 / $400,000 = 15%  
• Net Income: $30,000 / $400,000 = 7.5%  

This format reveals that of each dollar in sales, $0.70 goes to COGS, $0.15 goes to operating expenses, and $0.075 remains as net income. By computing such percentages, stakeholders can quickly spot if cost components are too high, or if the profit margin is substandard.

    E(Select Financial Statement) --> F(Choose Base Amount e.g. Net Sales)
    F --> G(Express Each Line as % of Base)

```

With a clear visual layout, you can see the main steps: selecting the statement, setting the right base amount, converting each line item into a percentage, and interpreting the findings.

### Advantages and Limitations of Vertical Analysis

Advantages:  
• Facilitates comparison of companies of different sizes (common-size statements).  
• Highlights cost structure and expense composition (e.g., portion of revenue consumed by COGS or SG&A).  
• Helps track structural changes within an entity over time (when combined with horizontal analysis).

Limitations:  
• Provides limited context about trends over multiple periods if used alone.  
• May mask absolute changes in revenue or costs (e.g., a 2% expense ratio increase could represent a significant dollar amount).  
• Potentially skewed if the base item experiences an unusual fluctuation.

## Combining Horizontal and Vertical Analysis

Most seasoned analysts and CPA Exam candidates use horizontal and vertical analysis together to obtain a well-rounded perspective. When performed alongside each other, these two techniques:

• Uncover yearly patterns in dollar and percentage changes across multiple periods (horizontal), while clarifying each line’s share of a total within each period (vertical).  
• Reveal if an entity’s revenue growth is outpacing (or trailing) expense growth; at the same time, highlight the expense distribution as a percentage of total costs.  
• Assist in diagnosing unusual or unexplained shifts in financial structure (e.g., a spike in net sales but minimal movement in cost of sales relative to the new revenue level).

### Practical Example: An Integrated Analysis

Consider a scenario where TLM Company has a three-year track record of sales growing from $200,000 to $240,000 to $280,000. If costs keep pace proportionally but remain at 60% of sales, vertical analysis might continue to reflect a stable COGS ratio. However, horizontal analysis would detect not just the percentage changes but also the absolute dollar rise in costs and potentially significant expansions in overhead categories.

By combining both techniques, an analyst sees:  
• The total dollar increase in sales and expenses (horizontal perspective).  
• Whether the structure, expressed as a percent of net sales, remains stable or starts to shift (vertical perspective).  

Comparisons of this nature help in evaluating profitability trends and cost management effectiveness, guiding better managerial decisions.

## Application to Not-for-Profit and Governmental Entities

While the mechanics of horizontal and vertical analysis remain largely the same, certain modifications apply to the not-for-profit (NFP) or governmental environment. As addressed in Chapter 4 (Not-for-Profit Entities) and Chapter 5 (State and Local Governments):

• For NFPs, the base for vertical analysis may be total support and revenue (instead of “sales”). Horizontal analysis still captures changes over time, but focus may be on net assets without donor restrictions versus with donor restrictions.  
• Government entities often use fund-level statements. A vertical analysis might look at each fund’s revenues and expenses in relation to the total resources for that fund, or the government-wide statements for a broader perspective. Horizontal analysis can track how fund balances or expenditures evolve across budget cycles.

## Implementation Considerations and Best Practices

• Ensure consistency in applying accounting principles across all periods you analyze; changes to a company’s revenue recognition policy or inventory costing method can distort period-to-period comparisons.  
• Adjust for one-time or non-recurring events to glean a more accurate “normal” trend. For instance, major divestitures or large acquisitions can distort horizontal or vertical analysis if recognized at face value.  
• Pair these analyses with deeper ratio analyses (see subsequent sections of Chapter 8) to form a cohesive, multi-faceted evaluation of financial health.  
• Document any underlying assumptions, especially regarding potential restatements of prior periods when an error correction or change in accounting principle (Chapter 18) has occurred.  
• Compare with industry benchmarks. If you have vertical analysis common-size statements for both the target entity and competing firms, you can quickly see if the company is in line with industry norms.

## Common Pitfalls

• Relying Exclusively on Percentage Changes: Focusing solely on percents without reviewing the dollar impact can overlook material changes or understate the significance of large outflows or inflows.  
• Ignoring Inflation or Currency Fluctuations: In times of high inflation or exchange rate shifts (Chapter 26 addressing Foreign Currency Transactions), horizontal analysis can be misleading unless adjustments are made.  
• Not Investigating Possible Causes: Observing a variance is one step; failing to examine underlying factors (e.g., changes in unit sales volume, pricing, or new marketing campaigns) prevents thorough analysis.  
• Misapplication of the Base for Vertical Analysis: Inappropriately selecting or mixing lines (e.g., comparing cost of goods sold to total liabilities) yields meaningless results.

## Real-World Scenarios and Case Studies

1. Startup Growth Analysis: A small tech startup sees revenue triple over a two-year period. Horizontal analysis shows a 200% jump in sales, but vertical analysis suggests expenses, as a percentage of revenue, also increased from 80% to 90%. This indicates an erosion of margins despite robust top-line growth.  
2. Mature Manufacturer: A large manufacturing firm uses 10 years of horizontal analysis data to identify cyclical patterns aligned with economic cycles. Vertical analysis reveals stable expenses at around 70% of revenue, which is typical for the industry, indicating consistent operational control.  
3. Nonprofit Fundraising Trends: An NFP uses horizontal analysis on contributions over five years, discovering a surge in one particular year due to a major donor. Vertical analysis of that year’s statement reveals that 60% of total contributions came from a single donor, cautioning the organization about reliance on one funding source.  
4. Municipal Government Expenditure Review: A municipal government analyzes its General Fund expenditures over a three-year budget cycle. Horizontal analysis shows a 30% overall increase, but vertical analysis notes that certain public safety costs, as a proportion of total expenditures, have climbed from 20% to 30%, indicating a growing priority area.

## Illustrative Tables

Below is a condensed illustration of how you might compare horizontal and vertical analyses for a hypothetical Company X over two years:

| Income Statement Item      | Year 1  (in $) | Year 2  (in $) | Horizontal % Change | Vertical % (Year 1) | Vertical % (Year 2) |
|----------------------------|---------------:|---------------:|---------------------:|---------------------:|---------------------:|
| Net Sales                  | 500,000        | 575,000        | 15%                 | 100%                | 100%                |
| Cost of Goods Sold         | 300,000        | 345,000        | 15%                 | 60%                 | 60%                 |
| Gross Profit               | 200,000        | 230,000        | 15%                 | 40%                 | 40%                 |
| Operating Expenses         | 100,000        | 110,000        | 10%                 | 20%                 | 19.1%               |
| Net Income                 | 60,000         | 73,000         | ~21.7%              | 12%                 | 12.7%               |

**Key Takeaways**:  
• Net sales grew by 15%.  
• COGS moved at the same rate (15%), indicating consistent gross margin.  
• Operating expenses increased at a slightly lower rate of 10%, which helped net income rise by a higher percentage (21.7%).  
• Vertical analysis underscores that the company maintained a steady cost structure (COGS remained at 60%), with a slight improvement in net income margin (from 12% to 12.7%).

By viewing both percentage changes over time (horizontal) and composition percentages within each year (vertical), management can quickly assess whether operational improvements or expansions are positively impacting its bottom line.

## Conclusion

Horizontal and vertical analysis are essential techniques for any professional engaged in financial statement analysis, from novices to seasoned CPAs. Horizontal analysis unveils the direction and rate of change over multiple periods, providing a dimensional view of growth or contraction. Vertical analysis centers on the proportion of each line item relative to a defined base, illuminating the financial structure and cost composition within a single period.

By merging these two analyses, you gain powerful insights into an entity’s operations, cost management, and capital structure. Far from being purely academic exercises, these methods guide everyday decision-making for CFOs, auditors, creditors, shareholders, and directors. They also form building blocks for more complex ratio and performance metrics — many of which the FAR Exam tests. Master these foundational tools to approach future exams and real-world work with confidence and clarity.

- [ ] Compare each line item as a proportion of a base amount in the same period.
- [ ] Assess how a single transaction impacts multiple accounts.
- [ ] Eliminate the need for a statement of cash flows.

> **Explanation:** Horizontal analysis looks at changes in absolute or percentage terms over multiple accounting periods, revealing trends and growth patterns.


### Which step best describes the final phase of horizontal analysis?
- [x] Analyzing and reporting trends to identify favorable or unfavorable changes.
- [ ] Adjusting for inflation before comparing financial data.
- [x] Calculating each line item as a percentage of total revenue.
- [ ] Preparing journal entries to correct prior-period errors.

> **Explanation:** Horizontal analysis culminates with analyzing data trends and reporting findings. Expressing line items as a percentage of total revenue is vertical analysis, not horizontal.


### In vertical analysis of an income statement, which of the following is generally used as the base?
- [x] Net sales or total revenue.
- [ ] Total assets.
- [ ] Net income.
- [ ] Dividends paid.

> **Explanation:** For an income statement, the base amount is typically net sales (or total revenue). Items are then stated as percentages of this base.


### One advantage of vertical analysis is that it:
- [x] Facilitates the comparison of firms of different sizes by using common-size statements.
- [ ] Eliminates the need for ratio analyses.
- [ ] Expresses changes in absolute dollar amounts across periods.
- [ ] Measures the impact of inflation on financial statements.

> **Explanation:** Vertical analysis creates common-size financial statements, making it easier to compare companies of varying scales.


### Which of the following is a best practice when performing horizontal analysis?
- [x] Ensure consistency in accounting methods across all periods and adjust for significant events.
- [ ] Use only percentages and ignore absolute dollar changes.
- [x] Focus exclusively on net income headings.
- [ ] Assume inflation is constant and not a factor.

> **Explanation:** Consistency in accounting methods and adjustments for major one-time events provide a clearer representation of genuine trends over time.


### When combining horizontal and vertical analysis, you:
- [x] Gain insight into both historical trends and structural composition.
- [ ] Must always restate prior-year statements to current-year dollars.
- [ ] Disregard changes in individual line items.
- [ ] Focus only on the statement of retained earnings.

> **Explanation:** Using both methods provides a more holistic view: horizontal analysis shows trends across periods, while vertical analysis depicts the proportion of each line item within a single period.


### A company’s operating expenses remain at 20% of net sales for two consecutive years, but net sales increase 25%. Which statement is correct?
- [x] The absolute dollar amount of operating expenses has increased.
- [ ] The company’s expenses must have decreased in dollar terms.
- [x] The net sales figure is irrelevant because percentages have stayed constant.
- [ ] The net income margin will necessarily decline.

> **Explanation:** The percentage remaining the same while sales rise means the total dollar amount for operating expenses also increased, as 20% of a higher sales base is a larger absolute figure.


### To perform a quick vertical analysis on a balance sheet:
- [x] Express each asset and liability as a percentage of total assets (or total liabilities and equity).
- [ ] Divide all items by net sales for that year.
- [ ] Take the difference between current and previous years to compute a percentage change.
- [ ] Compare every line item to total stockholders’ equity.

> **Explanation:** Vertical analysis on a balance sheet typically uses total assets (or total liabilities and equity) as the base.


### Which of the following might distort a straightforward horizontal analysis comparison?
- [x] Major acquisitions or divestitures within the period.
- [ ] Stable accounting policies and conventions.
- [ ] A consistent ratio of cost of goods sold to sales across periods.
- [ ] A fixed annual depreciation expense.

> **Explanation:** Large, non-recurring events like acquisitions or divestitures can significantly change the numbers and distort horizontal comparisons if not adjusted or explained.


### Vertical analysis often expresses cost of goods sold as 65% of sales. Is this statement true?
- [x] True
- [ ] False

> **Explanation:** In the income statement, cost of goods sold is commonly expressed as a percentage of net sales. Therefore, stating "COGS is 65% of net sales" is a typical output of vertical (common-size) analysis.
