## 28.4 GASB vs. FASB Notable Contrasts

Understanding the differences between the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is crucial for any accounting professional preparing for the Business Analysis and Reporting (BAR) section of the Uniform CPA Examination. While both boards aim to enhance the clarity, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting, their standards cater to different types of entities—governmental organizations for GASB, and private- or public-sector (non-governmental) organizations for FASB. These differences influence everything from conceptual frameworks to specific accounting treatments. This section outlines key contrasts, referencing common areas of divergence, and highlights relevant statements to deepen your analytical and reporting skills.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
### Overview of GASB vs. FASB

GASB governs accounting and financial reporting for state and local governments within the United States. Its standards focus on accountability, budgetary compliance, and “public stewardship” of resources. FASB, on the other hand, sets accounting standards for private entities, encompassing for-profit corporations and not-for-profit organizations (excluding governmental not-for-profits). Its conceptual framework prioritizes decision-usefulness for investors, creditors, and other stakeholders primarily interested in economic performance and financial position.

Both GASB and FASB operate under the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), which provides oversight and appoints board members. However, each board has its distinct mission and conceptual framework to guide how standards are proposed, developed, and implemented.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Conceptual Framework Differences

• Objectives of Financial Reporting
  – **GASB**: Emphasizes accountability and interperiod equity, focusing on how public resources are raised and used in providing services. GASB Statement No. 1 underscores the role of financial statements in demonstrating compliance with legislated budgets.  
  – **FASB**: Aims primarily to provide information useful in making investment, credit, and other economic decisions. FASB’s Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts (SFAC) No. 8 highlights the importance of valuation relevance and faithful representation for investors and creditors.

• Reporting Entity Considerations
  – **GASB**: Centers on the concept of primary governments and component units, reflecting the variety of services performed by a governmental entity.   
  – **FASB**: Focuses on controlling financial interests, variable interest entities (VIEs), and consolidated financial statements under ASC 810.

• User Needs
  – **GASB**: Public constituents, legislators, creditors (e.g., bondholders), and oversight bodies prioritize budget compliance, resource constraints, and service efforts.  
  – **FASB**: Equity shareholders, institutional investors, analysts, and creditors are interested in financial performance, earnings, cash flows, and governance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Measurement Focus and Basis of Accounting

A crucial distinction between GASB and FASB emerges in the measurement focus and basis of accounting. Governmental entities must produce two categories of financial statements:

1. **Government-Wide Statements** (Full Accrual)  
   – Utilize an economic resources measurement focus, similar to FASB, where all assets and liabilities are reported.

2. **Fund-Based Statements** (Modified Accrual for Governmental Funds)  
   – Recognize revenues when they become measurable and available. Expenditures typically recorded when liabilities are incurred.

By contrast, **FASB requires full accrual** basis accounting for all for-profit entities, with revenue recognized when earned and expenses when incurred. Not-for-profit entities under FASB do not use modified accrual; they adhere to accrual-based guidance with specialized classifications (e.g., net assets with donor restrictions vs. without donor restrictions).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Side-by-Side Comparison of Typical Items

To highlight the contrasts, the following table compares selected items under GASB vs. FASB standards, citing relevant pronouncements.

| **Accounting Area**                  | **GASB Guidance**                                                                                                             | **FASB Guidance**                                                                                                             |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Financial Statement Presentation

Under GASB standards, governmental entities prepare both government-wide financial statements (similar to corporate accrual accounting) and fund-based statements designed to capture specific activities (governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary funds). Each of these statements serves a unique purpose:

• **Government-Wide Financial Statements**  
  – Present a long-term, overall view of the government’s financial position.  
  – Consist of the Statement of Net Position and Statement of Activities, focusing on the economic resources measurement and full accrual basis.

• **Fund Financial Statements**  
  – Separate resources into different accounting funds (e.g., General Fund, Special Revenue Fund).  
  – Track inflows/outflows of current financial resources (modified accrual for governmental funds).  

In contrast, **FASB standards** require all business entities to prepare a **single set of general-purpose financial statements** on an accrual basis:

• **Statement of Financial Position** (Balance Sheet)  
• **Statement of Comprehensive Income** (Income Statement plus Other Comprehensive Income)  
• **Statement of Cash Flows**  
• **Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity** (or Net Assets for not-for-profits)  

Not-for-profit organizations also follow **ASC 958**, which emphasizes net assets classification (with donor restrictions vs. without donor restrictions), but they do not prepare separate governmental fund statements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Focus on Accountability vs. Decision-Usefulness

**GASB** focuses on public accountability:  
• Emphasizes whether resources were raised and used according to legal or budgetary mandates.  
• Demonstrates whether current-year revenues can cover current-year expenses or if past/current actions shift financial burdens to future taxpayers.  
• Is vital for evaluating compliance with state or municipal charters, bond covenants, and voter-approved initiatives.

**FASB** focuses on decision-usefulness for capital providers:  
• Highlights earnings, cash flows, and changes in equity for investors and creditors.  
• Guides investment, lending, and other resource allocation decisions based on financial performance and risk evaluation.  
• Encourages uniform performance metrics across industries, allowing comparability for shareholder and creditor analysis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Practical Example: Intangible Assets in Government vs. Private Sector

Consider a municipality investing in specialized environmental software to manage water treatment data:

• **GASB**:  
  – Relevant standard: GASB Statement No. 51 (Accounting and Financial Reporting for Intangible Assets).  
  – If the municipality develops software internally, certain development phase costs may be capitalized; research and preliminary stage costs are expensed.  
  – Post-implementation/operation costs are typically expensed unless they extend the useful life or functionality significantly.  
  – The software value appears in the Statement of Net Position under capital assets or intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization.

• **FASB**:  
  – Relevant standard: ASC 350 (Intangibles – Goodwill and Other) and ASC 985 for software.  
  – Internally developed software costs in the application development stage may be capitalized; ongoing maintenance is expensed.  
  – Additional complexities arise for software as a service (SaaS), where intangible asset recognition may differ.  
  – The intangible asset is reported on the Balance Sheet at cost, net of amortization or impairment losses.

In both cases, the core principle (capitalizing certain development costs for software) is similar, but the nature of disclosures, classification, and the overarching framework differ based on the GASB vs. FASB environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example: Pension and OPEB Accounting

Public pension plans often loom large in state and local government financial statements. Under GASB:

• **GASB 68 (Employers)** and **GASB 67 (Plans)** define the Net Pension Liability as the difference between the total pension liability and the plan’s net assets.  
• Government-wide statements require recognition of the net pension liability on the Statement of Net Position.  
• Expenses are allocated systematically to reflect service cost, interest on the liability, and changes in plan fiduciary net position.

Under **FASB ASC 715**, an employer’s pension obligations are reported based on the projected benefit obligation (PBO). Differences exist in how changes in assumptions or actuarial gains/losses are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). For not-for-profit organizations under FASB, similar rules apply, but OCI may be referred to as changes in net assets without donor restrictions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Derivatives Accounting Contrasts

• **GASB 53**:  
  – Governmental entities record derivative instruments at fair value.  
  – The focus is on hedge effectiveness with changes reported as deferred outflows/inflows if the derivative is deemed an effective hedge under GASB’s criteria.  
  – If ineffective, changes in fair value flow through the Statement of Activities.

• **FASB ASC 815**:  
  – Entities record derivatives at fair value, with changes recognized in earnings or OCI, based on the nature of hedges (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, net investment hedge).  
  – Hedge accounting is contingent on meeting strict criteria, including documentation and ongoing effectiveness testing.  

Though the principles overlap, the classification of deferred outflows/inflows under GASB diverges from FASB’s reliance on OCI for certain hedging relationships.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Diagram: High-Level Comparison of GASB vs. FASB

Below is a simplified Mermaid flowchart illustrating the core differences in reporting emphasis:

    E --> H["Modified Accrual <br/>Reporting"]
    F --> I["Full Accrual <br/>Reporting"]
    G --> J["Full Accrual <br/>Reporting"]
```

• **Left Branch (GASB)**: Emphasizes both fund-based and government-wide statements, with modified accrual in governmental funds and full accrual in government-wide financials.  
• **Right Branch (FASB)**: Primarily focuses on a single set of full accrual financial statements for all private enterprises and not-for-profits.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Common Pitfalls and Challenges in Comparing GASB and FASB

1. **Misapplication of Fund Accounting**: Students often confuse fund-based statements with standard accrual reporting. Remember that only GASB standards require modified accrual accounting for certain funds, whereas FASB never does.  
2. **Disclosures Around Public Stewardship**: GASB calls for additional accountability disclosures, including budget-to-actual comparisons, which are foreign in FASB-based statements.  
3. **Classification of Net Assets**: Governmental entities use the term “net position” with specific restrictions, while FASB references “net assets” or “equity.”  
4. **Overlap in Pension and OPEB**: Both have net liability concepts, but the measurement, presentation, and disclosure details differ, leading to confusion if one tries to apply private-sector rules to public entities or vice versa.  
5. **Timing of Revenue Recognition**: Under GASB, nonexchange transactions (taxes, grants) may be recognized differently compared to typical exchange transactions in FASB-based entities, especially regarding availability periods.  
6. **Lease Accounting Classifications**: GASB 87 and FASB ASC 842 share many conceptual underpinnings but differ in terminology and certain application thresholds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Best Practices for BAR Candidates

• **Stay Focused on Entity Type**: Ensure you correctly identify whether an entity is subject to GASB or FASB. The correct standard application hinges on the nature of the entity (government vs. private/not-for-profit).  
• **Leverage Summaries and Flowcharts**: Summaries of standards can help keep critical differences at your fingertips. Flowcharts allow you to visualize which standards apply to which types of transactions.  
• **Review Official Pronouncements**: For deeper knowledge, consult specific GASB and FASB statements in detail, especially for complex topics such as pensions or derivatives.  
• **Practice with Real-World Scenarios**: Construct sample transactions—e.g., a municipality issuing bonds or a private tech startup granting stock options—and apply the relevant standard.  
• **Cross-Reference with Other Chapters**: Governmental accounting topics are covered thoroughly in Chapters 19–22 of this guide. Technical accounting and reporting for private entities can be found in Chapters 10–18.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Case Study: Lease Accounting

Imagine a local government leasing a new administrative office building, while a private manufacturer leases specialized equipment.

• **Government Context (GASB)**:  
  – Under GASB 87, the government-lessee would record a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset.  
  – Annual budgeting processes and debt limit restrictions may come into play.  
  – Disclosures may involve future lease payments separated by purpose or function in the governmental funds.

• **Private Sector (FASB)**:  
  – Under ASC 842, the manufacturer-lessee classifies the lease as operating or finance.  
  – Records a lease liability and a right-of-use asset and recognizes lease expense over the term for operating leases.  
  – Impact on debt ratios and compliance with covenants is central to investor and creditor analysis.

Despite the conceptual similarities—both statements aim to ensure lease obligations appear on the balance sheet—practical application differs due to the distinctive accountability framework for governments.
