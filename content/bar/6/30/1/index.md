## 30.1 Topical Index

This Topical Index is designed to be your quick-reference companion for pinpointing exactly where key ideas, concepts, and terminologies appear throughout the “Certified Public Accountant (CPA, AICPA®), Uniform CPA Examination Blueprints (Effective date: January 2025): Business Analysis and Reporting (BAR) Examination Supplemental Guide.” It is organized alphabetically by major subject areas and individual topics, enabling you to swiftly search and find all relevant sections. Where appropriate, subtopics are listed under a broader heading to help you correlate connected ideas.

Use this resource as a jumping-off point to deepen your knowledge in a specific area, brush up on essential standards, or identify all chapters that touch upon a concept you’d like to revisit. Where possible, references are provided with chapter numbers and subchapter titles to guide you directly to the most relevant reading.

Feel free to explore the index as your study path evolves. If you’re preparing for the Uniform CPA Examination or simply broadening your accounting and business analysis acumen, the Topical Index will help you build a strong foundation and quickly find the information you need.

• When uncertain where a topic may appear, scan through related keywords and synonyms, as many entries cross-reference each other.  
• Integrate this index with the Glossary in Chapter 28 for definitions of any unfamiliar terms.

## Practical Formula Reminder

Many of the chapters within this guide rely on standard formulas for financial calculations. As a refresher, here is one frequently encountered formula in both managerial and financial contexts:

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):

{{< katex >}}
WACC = \left(\frac{E}{V}\right) R_e + \left(\frac{D}{V}\right) R_d (1 - T)
{{< /katex >}}

where:  
• E = Market value of the firm’s equity  
• D = Market value of the firm’s debt  
• V = E + D (total market value of capital)  
• Rₑ = Cost of equity  
• R_d = Cost of debt  
• T = Corporate tax rate  

For a more comprehensive list of formulas related to business analysis, budgeting, valuation, and risk assessment, consult Chapter 27 (Key Formulas, Ratios, and Quick Reference).
