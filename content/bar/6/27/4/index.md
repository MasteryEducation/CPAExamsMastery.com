## 27.4 Governmental Accounting Reference Tables

This section offers a collection of key Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) statements, their primary focus, and their typical usage scenarios in state and local governments. These reference tables aim to support both emerging and seasoned accounting professionals seeking a quick refresher on the wide range of standards that shape governmental financial reporting and transparency. Drawing upon concepts introduced in Chapters 19 through 22 of this guide, this reference consolidates core information into concise bullet points so that you can easily locate authoritative guidance when dealing with real-world government accounting issues.

It is important to understand how these GASB pronouncements intersect with the fundamental structures of governmental entities—such as funds, measurement focus, and basis of accounting. By mastering these references, practitioners and CPA candidates can strengthen their comprehension and application of governmental accounting principles, ensuring high-quality, standards-compliant financial statements.

### Purpose and Utility of Governmental Accounting Reference Tables

• Provide a foundation for referencing key GASB statements and guidance.  
• Support quicker decision-making and clarity when facing nuanced or complex governmental transactions.  
• Complement deep-dive discussions in Chapters 19–22, offering quick bullet-point highlights.  
• Enhance exam preparation by summarizing each standard’s primary objective and key usage scenarios.

---

### Core Governmental Accounting Structures Recap

Before diving into individual GASB statements, remember that governmental accounting involves multiple layers of reporting. Government-wide financial statements emphasize broad overview and economic resources measurement focus (accrual basis of accounting), while fund-based statements focus on particular funds using different measurement focuses. As discussed in Chapters 19–21:

• Governmental Funds (e.g., General Fund, Special Revenue Fund, Debt Service Fund, Capital Projects Fund, Permanent Fund) use the modified accrual basis and a current financial resources measurement focus.  
• Proprietary Funds (Enterprise and Internal Service) rely on the accrual basis and economic resources measurement focus, similar to for-profit entities.  
• Fiduciary Funds (Pension, Investment, Private-Purpose, and Custodial) also use the accrual basis with an economic resources measurement focus but are reported only in fund statements, not in government-wide statements.

The following Mermaid diagram illustrates the high-level structural relationships in governmental accounting:

```mermaid

    A["Government-wide <br/>Statements"] --> B["Governmental Activities"]
    A --> C["Business-type Activities"]
    B --> D["Governmental Funds <br/>(Modified Accrual)"]
    C --> E["Proprietary Funds <br/>(Accrual)"]
    B --> F["Fiduciary Funds <br/>(Accrual, <br/>Economic Resources)"]
```

Above, government-wide statements are the umbrella that consolidates activities across the entity. However, the detailed figures often originate in separate funds with distinct bases of accounting, which then must be reconciled to the government-wide viewpoint.

### Practical Examples of Applying GASB Standards

• Budgetary Shortfalls & GASB 54:  
  - A city’s General Fund experiences unexpected shortfalls. The city uses restricted and committed classifications to highlight resources that cannot be used for general purposes. GASB 54 ensures clarity in distinguishing which amounts remain legally protected vs. free for reallocation.

• Pension Funding & GASB 68:  
  - A county with a defined benefit pension plan measures its Net Pension Liability each year using updated actuarial assumptions. GASB 68 ensures that future service costs and interest are properly recorded and that the liability is recognized in the government-wide statements.

• OPEB Health Plans & GASB 75:  
  - A school district offering postemployment healthcare calculates present values of estimated benefit outlays. GASB 75 requires disclosure of this long-term commitment and includes sensitivity analyses reflecting discount-rate variations.

• Major Lease Agreement & GASB 87:  
  - A transit authority enters a 10-year lease for additional parking facilities. GASB 87 mandates that the entity record a Lease Asset (the right to use the parking structure) and a Lease Liability (the obligation to make lease payments) on government-wide statements.

• Technology Subscriptions & GASB 96:  
  - A city migrates its ERP system to a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. GASB 96 stipulates that the city treats the subscription similarly to a lease, with intangible rights-of-use and associated liability if the subscription meets specific contractual definitions.

---

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

• Regularly Update Actuarial Reports:  
  - For pension and OPEB standards (GASB 68 and GASB 75), failing to update actuarial valuations can distort liability calculations and hamper transparency.

• Proper Fund Classification:  
  - Misclassifying resources under GASB 54 can lead to misinterpretations of fiscal health. Always ensure legal restrictions or trustee stipulations are properly documented.

• Timely Implementation:  
  - GASB releases new updates regularly. Jurisdictions often struggle to implement new standards, such as GASB 87 or GASB 96, if they lack thorough policy reviews and staff training.

• Reporting Accuracy for Fiduciary Funds:  
  - Local governments sometimes mix fiduciary activities with general operations. Ensure that fiduciary activities follow GASB 84 criteria so the correct amounts appear in fiduciary funds.

• Lease vs. Operating Agreements:  
  - Under GASB 87, practitioners sometimes confuse short-term leases or service agreements for capital leases. Confirm the arrangement qualifies under the new single-model approach.

• Documentation of Public-Private Partnerships:  
  - With PPPs (GASB 94), complexities often arise regarding asset ownership and revenue-sharing. Robust legal contracts and policy documentation aid in consistent accounting treatment.

---

### Working with GASB Statements: Implementation Tips

• Cross-Reference the Governmental GAAP Hierarchy:  
  - When in doubt, consult the official publications of GASB to ensure that your interpretations align with authoritative guidance.

• Use Flowcharts for Decision-Making:  
  - For complex standards (leases, PPPs, etc.), consider visual decision trees to confirm if a transaction meets recognition thresholds.

• Communicate Changes to Stakeholders:  
  - When implementing new GASB standards (like GASB 96 for IT subscriptions), collaborate with IT teams and budget offices to gather accurate contract data and cost structures.

• Leverage Resources in Chapter 29:  
  - Chapter 29 provides sample checklists and templates that can be adapted to track compliance with each GASB statement.
